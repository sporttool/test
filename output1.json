    "CONTRIBUTING.md": "# Contributing\n\nIf you want to contribute to this repository - thank you! Before you start, have a look at the existing documentation to get an idea of the structure and writing conventions n8n uses. In writing your documentation, please follow the guidelines described below, to ensure quality and consistency with n8n styles.\n\n## Before you start\n\n### Style\n\nn8n uses the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).\n\nRefer to [Styles](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/wiki/Styles/) for a quickstart, and guidance on style linting.\n\n### n8n's license\n\nBe aware that n8n is fair code licensed. For more information, refer to the [License](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) documentation.\n\n## Writing docs\n\nYou can either:\n\n* Check out the docs repository and work on your local machine.\n* Make your changes directly in GitHub.\n\nThese instructions are for external users. Members of the n8n organization don't need to fork the repository.\n\n### Working locally\n\nThis method allows you to work in your own text editor, and preview your work while editing.\n\nYou need Git installed, and a GitHub account.\n\n[Fork the documentation repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\nThen clone your fork:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/<your-username>/n8n-docs.git\ncd n8n-docs\ngit checkout -b <branch-name>\n```\n\nMake your changes. Push your branch:\n\n```\ngit add *\ngit commit -m \"<short summary of changes>\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>\n```\n\nIn GitHub, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to merge the work from your fork to `main` in the docs repository.\n\n### Writing in GitHub\n\nThis method is fine for small changes, but not recommended for larger pieces of work.\n\nYou need a GitHub account.\n\nFollow GitHub's documentation on [editing files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files).\n\n### Previewing your work\n\nYou can build the docs locally to preview them, or submit a pull request. All pull requests automatically trigger a preview build.\n\nFor instructions on previewing the docs locally, refer to the [README](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/main/README.md).\n\n### General checklist\n\nBefore submitting a PR, make sure your contribution ticks all these boxes:\n\n- [ ] All necessary files and images are included.\n- [ ] All links are working and direct to the right location.\n- [ ] All documentation files end with an empty newline.\n- [ ] The commit message describes the changes you made.\n- [ ] The PR explains the changes you made and why they're necessary.\n- [ ] You have read and accepted the [code of conduct](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [contributor license agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md).\n\n\n## Documenting nodes\n\nn8n provides [templates](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/tree/main/document-templates) for node docs.\n\n* **Nodes and trigger nodes:** Create a directory with the name of the node at `docs/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/` or `docs/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/` containing:\n\n  - A text file named `n8n-nodes-base.<node-name>.md` describing the functionality of the relevant node.\n\n* **Credentials:** Create a document with the name of the node at `docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/` containing:\n  - A text file with the node name describing how to get credentials for the relevant node.\n\nA standard node doc includes the following parts:\n\n* Node description\n  - Describe the purpose and function of the node.\n* Operations\n  - Enter the resources and operations as they're named in the nodes.\n\nIn the credentials doc:\n\n* If there is more than one authentication method, list OAuth first.\n* If possible, avoid documenting external products. Instead, provide links to the relevant product documentation. For example, for guidance on getting credentials (such as how to get an API token for a service), provide a link to the product's API authentication docs.",

    "create-n8n-nodes-module.md": "# Creating n8n-nodes-module\n\n[TODO: this is the most up to date method, use it]\n\nIn this guide, you'll learn to create a custom n8n-nodes-module that can be installed separately alongside your n8n instance. The n8n-nodes-module is an npm package that contains the node. Your custom node will get loaded automatically when n8n starts.\n\nConsider creating n8n-nodes-module if any of the following conditions satisfy your needs:\n- The nodes are only for yourself, your organization, or a small group of people.\n- The nodes require external dependencies that are not already available in n8n.\n\n**NOTE:** n8n-nodes-module can only be installed in self-hosted n8n instances. This functionality is currently not available on n8n Cloud or the desktop app. There are plans to introduce this functionality in the future.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou may already be familiar with creating nodes in n8n. If you are unfamiliar with how to create n8n nodes, you can learn about it following the instructions mentioned in the [Creating Your First Node](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/creating-nodes/create-node.html) tutorial.\n\nInstall the following tools:\n\n- **Git:** You can find instructions on how to install Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n- **Node.js and npm:** You can find instructions how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). The current minimum version is `14.15`. In case you already have Node.js and npm installed, you can check the current version with the following command:\n\t```bash\n\tnode -v\n\tnpm -v\n\t```\n\n**NOTE:** Use node version `14.x` and npm version `6.x`. If using npm version `7+`, you must enable legacy peer dependencies by setting: `npm config set legacy-peer-deps true`.\n\n[TODO: remove lerna per alex]\n\n- **Lerna:** You can install lerna globally with the following command:\n\t```bash\n\tnpm i\n\t```\n\n- Install n8n: Create a new folder and install n8n using the command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install n8n\n```\n\n## Create custom n8n-nodes-module\n\nYou can create multiple n8n-nodes-modules. Each individual n8n-nodes-module should get created in a separate folder since they are different npm packages. A single n8n-nodes-module can contain multiple nodes. If you're creating multiple nodes in the same module, as a best practice create each node in a separate folder.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will create an n8n-nodes-module for the OpenWeatherMap API. You will name it ***n8n-nodes-weather***.\n\nTo quickly get started, clone the example starter using the following command:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter.git n8n-nodes-weather.\n```\n\nAfter the repo gets cloned, open the package.json file, and update the value of the name by replacing `n8n-nodes-starter` with `n8n-nodes-weather`.\n\n**NOTE:** The name of the module has to start with `n8n-nodes-`.\n\nOpen the cloned repository in your code editor, and create a new folder called `Weather`, inside the ***nodes*** folder. Create `Weather.node.ts` file inside the Weather folder and paste the following code:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n\tIDataObject,\n\tIExecuteFunctions,\n\tINodeExecutionData,\n\tINodeType,\n\tINodeTypeDescription,\n\tIRequestOptions,\n\tNodeApiError,\n\tNodeOperationError,\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\nexport class Weather implements INodeType {\n\tdescription: INodeTypeDescription = {\n\t\tdisplayName: 'Weather',\n\t\tname: 'Weather',\n\t\ticon: 'fa:sun',\n\t\tgroup: ['input'],\n\t\tversion: 1,\n\t\tdescription: 'Gets current and future weather information',\n\t\tdefaults: {\n\t\t\tname: 'Weather',\n\t\t\tcolor: '#554455',\n\t\t},\n\t\tinputs: ['main'],\n\t\toutputs: ['main'],\n\t\tcredentials: [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tname: 'weatherApi',\n\t\t\t\trequired: true,\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t],\n\t\tproperties: [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tdisplayName: 'Operation',\n\t\t\t\tname: 'operation',\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'options',\n\t\t\t\toptions: [\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname: 'Current Weather',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: 'currentWeather',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdescription: 'Returns the current weather data',\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname: '5 day Forecast',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: '5DayForecast',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdescription: 'Returns the weather data for the next 5 days',\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\tdefault: 'currentWeather',\n\t\t\t\tdescription: 'The operation to perform.',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tdisplayName: 'Format',\n\t\t\t\tname: 'format',\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'options',\n\t\t\t\toptions: [\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname: 'Imperial',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: 'imperial',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdescription: 'Fahrenheit | miles/hour',\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname: 'Metric',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: 'metric',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdescription: 'Celsius | meter/sec',\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname: 'Scientific',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: 'standard',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdescription: 'Kelvin | meter/sec',\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\tdefault: 'metric',\n\t\t\t\tdescription: 'The format in which format the data should be returned.',\n\t\t\t},\n\n\t\t\t// ----------------------------------\n\t\t\t//         Location Information\n\t\t\t// ----------------------------------\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tdisplayName: 'Location Selection',\n\t\t\t\tname: 'locationSelection',\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'options',\n\t\t\t\toptions: [\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname: 'City Name',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: 'cityName',\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname: 'City ID',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: 'cityId',\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname: 'Coordinates',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: 'coordinates',\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname: 'Zip Code',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: 'zipCode',\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\tdefault: 'cityName',\n\t\t\t\tdescription: 'How to define the location for which to return the weather.',\n\t\t\t},\n\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tdisplayName: 'City',\n\t\t\t\tname: 'cityName',\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'string',\n\t\t\t\tdefault: '',\n\t\t\t\tplaceholder: 'berlin,de',\n\t\t\t\trequired: true,\n\t\t\t\tdisplayOptions: {\n\t\t\t\t\tshow: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlocationSelection: [\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'cityName',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\tdescription: 'The name of the city to return the weather of.',\n\t\t\t},\n\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tdisplayName: 'City ID',\n\t\t\t\tname: 'cityId',\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'number',\n\t\t\t\tdefault: 160001123,\n\t\t\t\trequired: true,\n\t\t\t\tdisplayOptions: {\n\t\t\t\t\tshow: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlocationSelection: [\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'cityId',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\tdescription: 'The id of city to return the weather of.

Create `WeatherApi.credentials.ts` file in the ***Credentials*** folder and paste the following code:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n\tICredentialType,\n\tINodeProperties,\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\n\nexport class WeatherApi implements ICredentialType {\n\tname = 'weatherApi';\n\tdisplayName = 'Weather API';\n\tproperties: INodeProperties[] = [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tdisplayName: 'Access Token',\n\t\t\tname: 'accessToken',\n\t\t\ttype: 'string',\n\t\t\tdefault: '',\n\t\t},\n\t];\n}\n```\n\nAdd the newly created node and the credential to the package.json file. Add `\"dist/nodes/Weather/Weather.node.js\"` to the ***nodes*** array in the ***n8n*** object (`n8n.nodes`). Similarly, add `\"dist/credentials/WeatherApi.credentials.js\"` to the ***credentials*** array in the ***n8n*** object (`n8n.credentials`).\n\n## Develop and test the module\n\nOnce you've created the n8n-nodes-module, you need to build the code and publish the package locally to test it. Run the following commands:\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Build the code\nnpm run build\n\n# \"Publish\" the package locally\nnpm link\n```\n\n**NOTE:** If you get permission errors, run the command as a root user with `sudo`, for example `sudo npm link`.\n\nIn the terminal, open the folder where you installed n8n. Run the following command to install the locally published module.\n\n```bash\n# \"Install\" the above locally published module\nnpm link n8n-nodes-weather\n```\n\nStart n8n with the below command\n\n```bash\n./node_modules/n8n/bin/n8n start\n```\n\nYou will now be able to test and use your newly created n8n-nodes-module.\n\n## Publish the n8n-nodes-module\n\nAs mentioned, the n8n-nodes-module is an npm package. To make it available to others, you can publish it to the npm registry. Refer to the [Publishing unscoped public packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages#publishing-unscoped-public-packages) guide to learn about publishing packages.\n\nFollowing the steps mentioned above, you can create multiple nodes within a single n8n-nodes-module. You can also create nodes that require dependencies that are not present in n8n. When creating an n8n-nodes-module make sure that you follow the following guidelines:\n\n- The name of the module should start with `n8n-nodes-`.\n- The `package.json` file has to contain a key `n8n` with the paths to nodes and credentials.\n- The module has to be installed alongside n8n.\n\n## Use the n8n-nodes-module in production\n\nOnce you test and publish your n8n-nodes-module you would want to use it in your production environment.\n\nIf you're running n8n via Docker, you will have to create a Docker image with the node module installed in n8n. Follow the steps below to create your Docker image:\n\n1. Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile).\n2. Add the following command in your Dockerfile before the font installation command.\n\n\t```Dockerfile\n\tRUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install n8n-nodes-weather\n\t```\n\n\tYour Dockerfile should look like this:\n\n\t```Dockerfile\n\tFROM node:16-alpine\n\n\tARG N8N_VERSION\n\n\tRUN if [ -z \"$N8N_VERSION\" ] ; then echo \"The N8N_VERSION argument is missing!\" ; exit 1; fi\n\n\t# Update everything and install needed dependencies\n\tRUN apk add --update graphicsmagick tzdata git tini su-exec\n\n\t# Set a custom user to not have n8n run as root\n\tUSER root\n\n\t# Install n8n and the packages it needs to build it correctly.\n\tRUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies python3 build-base ca-certificates && \\\n\t\tnpm config set python \"$(which python3)\" && \\\n\t\tnpm_config_user=root npm install -g full-icu n8n@${N8N_VERSION} && \\\n\t\tapk del build-dependencies \\\n\t\t&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root;\n\n\t# Install your n8n-nodes-module. Replace <n8n-nodes-module> with the name of your module\n\tRUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install <n8n-nodes-module>\n\n\t# Install fonts\n\tRUN apk --no-cache add --virtual fonts msttcorefonts-installer fontconfig && \\\n\t\tupdate-ms-fonts && \\\n\t\tfc-cache -f && \\\n\t\tapk del fonts && \\\n\t\tfind  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/ -type l -exec unlink {} \\; \\\n\t\t&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root\n\n\tENV NODE_ICU_DATA /usr/local/lib/node_modules/full-icu\n\n\tWORKDIR /data\n\n\tCOPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh\n\tENTRYPOINT [\"tini\", \"--\", \"/docker-entrypoint.sh\"]\n\n\tEXPOSE 5678/tcp\n\t```\n\n3. Download the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/docker-entrypoint.sh) file, and place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile.\n\n4. Build your Docker image:\n\n\t```Dockerfile\n\t# Replace <n8n-version-number> with the n8n release version number.\n\t# For example, N8N_VERSION=0.177.0\n\tdocker build --build-arg N8N_VERSION=<n8n-version-number> --tag=customizedn8n .\n\t```\n\nYou can now use your n8n-nodes-module in Docker.\n\nIf you're running either by installing it globally or using PM2, make sure that you install your n8n-nodes-module inside n8n. n8n will find the module and load it automatically.",
    "create-trigger-node.md": "---\ncontentType: tutorial\n---\n\n# Creating Your First Trigger Node\n\nThis tutorial walks through building a trigger node.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou need the following installed on your development machine:\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/prerequisites.md\"\n\nYou need some understanding of:\n\n- JavaScript/TypeScript\n- REST APIs\n- Webhooks\n- Expressions in n8n\n- git\n\n\n\n## Build your node\n\nThe first thing that we have to do is pick the service we want to create the node for. We will use [Autopilot](https://www.autopilothq.com/) as an example.\n\n\nSince n8n's repository already has a Autopilot Trigger node, we will name this node **Autofriend Trigger** to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the project\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/tutorial-set-up-project.md\"\n\n\n## Creating the node\n\n1. Go to `packages/nodes-base/nodes`.\n2. Create a folder called `Autofriend` (the folder names are PascalCase).\n3. Within the Autofriend folder, create a file called `AutofriendTrigger.node.ts` (YourNodeNameTrigger.node.ts).\n4. Download and add the Autofriend [icon](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autopilot/autopilot.svg) to the folder. Name it `autopilot.svg`.\n\t- The icon property has to be either a 60x60 pixels PNG or an SVG and must exist in the node's folder.\n\t- An SVG is preferable. In case you have to use a PNG, make sure that it's compressed. A good tool for that's [tinypng](https://tinypng.com).\n\t- A good place to find company icons is [gilbarbara/logos](https://github.com/gilbarbara/logos/tree/master/logos).\n5. Paste the following code in the `AutofriendTrigger.node.ts` file.\n\n```typescript\nimport {\n   IDataObject,\n   IHookFunctions,\n   INodeType,\n   INodeTypeDescription,\n   IWebhookFunctions,\n   IWebhookResponseData,\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\n/*\nimport {\n\tautofriendApiRequest,\n} from './GenericFunctions';\n\nimport {\n\tsnakeCase,\n} from 'change-case';\n*/\n\n\nexport class AutofriendTrigger implements INodeType {\n   description: INodeTypeDescription = {\n\t   displayName: 'Autofriend Trigger',\n\t   name: 'autofriendTrigger',\n\t   icon: 'file:autofriend.svg',\n\t   group: ['trigger'],\n\t   version: 1,\n\t   subtitle: '={{$parameter[\"event\"]}}',\n\t   description: 'Handle Autofriend events using webhooks',\n\t   defaults: {\n\t\t   name: 'Autofriend Trigger',\n\t\t   color: '#6ad7b9',\n\t   },\n\t   inputs: [],\n\t   outputs: ['main'],\n\t   credentials: [],\n\t   webhooks: [\n\t\t   {\n\t\t\t   name: 'default',\n\t\t\t   httpMethod: 'POST',\n\t\t\t   responseMode: 'onReceived',\n\t\t\t   path: 'webhook',\n\t\t   },\n\t   ],\n\t   properties: [],\n   };\n   async webhook(this: IWebhookFunctions): Promise<IWebhookResponseData> {\n\t   return {\n\t\t   workflowData: [],\n\t   };\n   }\n}\n```\n\nYour directory structure should now look like the following.\n\n![Autofriend's directory structure](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/autopilot-directory-structure.png)\n\n\n## Adding the node to Editor UI\n\nn8n uses the properties set in the property `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `name`, `color`, `icon`, `description`, and `subtitle`.\n\nCheck the following figure to see how the properties affect the looks of the node.\n\n![Autofriend's appearance in Editor UI](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/autopilot-appearance.png)\n\n**Note:** The property description conforms to [INodeTypeDescription](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/f2666e92ffed2c3983d08e73b1e45a2bd516b90d/packages/workflow/src/Interfaces.ts#L425).\n\nLet's see how the node looks in the UI by following these steps:\n\n1. Go to `/packages/nodes-base/package.json`.\n2. Paste `\"dist/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.js\",` in the nodes array to register the node (in an alphabetical order).\n3. Go to the project's main folder (n8n) in the terminal and run the following commands (it can take a few minutes).\n\t- The first command installs all dependencies of all the modules and links them together.\n\t- The second command builds all the code.\n\t- The third command starts n8n in development mode.\n\n```bash\nlerna bootstrap --hoist\nnpm run build\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n4. Open your browser and go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and you should be able to see the Editor UI.\n5. Open the ***Create Node*** menu, select the ***Trigger*** tab, type `Autofriend`, and click on it to add the node to the Editor UI.\n\n**Notes**\n\n- On startup, n8n will load all the nodes and credentials (more about credentials later) that are registered in `/packages/nodes-base/package.json`.\n- The property `description.name` uses camelCase.\n- The property `description.color` is the company's branding color in hexadecimal. In case the website doesn'tinclude this information, there are other websites that help you get a company's branding colors. For example, [brandpalettes.com](https://brandpalettes.com/).\n\n\n## Creating the UI for the node\n\nDouble-clicking on the Autofriend Trigger node will open the Node Editor View. It will be empty since we haven't added any UI components yet. Luckily, n8n provides predefined JSON-based UI components that we can use to ask the user for different types of data.\n\nAutopilots's [docs](https://autopilot.docs.apiary.io/#reference/rest-hooks/register-rest-hook/register-a-rest-hook) mention that to create a hook, we need to provide the following pieces of information:\n\n- event - Required\n- target_url - Required\n\nIn the `event` parameter, we provide the name of the event for which we want to be notified. For example, `contact_added`. As the name implies, by providing `contact_added` as the event, we will be notified every time a contact is added to Autofriend.\n\nIn the `target_url` parameter, we provide the URL where Autofriend will notify us when the event defined in the event parameter takes place. We don't need to ask the user for this parameter as n8n provides us with a method to obtain it.\n\n\n### Adding the fields\n\nLet's make the Node Editor View ask for these parameters:\n1. Add the following under `description.properties` in `packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.ts.`.\n\n```typescript\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Event',\n\tname: 'event',\n\ttype: 'options',\n\trequired: true,\n\tdefault: '',\n\toptions: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'Contact Added',\n\t\t\tvalue: 'contactAdded',\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'Contact Added To List',\n\t\t\tvalue: 'contactAddedToList',\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'Contact Entered Segment',\n\t\t\tvalue: 'contactEnteredSegment',\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'Contact Left Segment',\n\t\t\tvalue: 'contactLeftSegment',\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'Contact Removed From List',\n\t\t\tvalue: 'contactRemovedFromList',\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'Contact Unsubscribed',\n\t\t\tvalue: 'contactUnsubscribed',\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'Contact Updated',\n\t\t\tvalue: 'contactUpdated',\n\t\t},\n\t],\n},\n```\n\n2. Stop the current n8n process by pressing `ctrl + c` in the terminal in which you are running n8n.\n3. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal.\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n4. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/), refresh the page, and open the node again.\n\nThe node should now look like in the following image.\n\n![Autofriend's required fields](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/autofriend-fields.png)\n\n\n## Creating the UI for credentials\n\nMost REST APIs use some sort of authentication mechanism. Autofriend's REST API uses API Keys. The API Key informs them about who is making the request to their system and gives you access to all the functionality that the API provides. Given all the things it can do, this has to be treated as a sensitive piece of information and should be kept private.\n\nn8n gives you the ability to ask for sensitive information using credentials. In the credentials, you can use all the generally available UI elements. Additionally, the data that's stored using the credentials would be encrypted before being saved to the database. In order to do that, n8n uses an encryption key.\n\nWith that in mind, let's create the UI to ask for the user's Autofriend API Key. The process of creating and registering credentials is similar to that of creating and registering the node:\n\n1. Go to `packages/nodes-base/credentials`.\n2. Within the credentials folder, create a file named `AutofriendApi.credentials.ts`.\n3. Paste the following code.\n\n```typescript\nimport {\n\tICredentialType,\n\tNodePropertyTypes,\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\nexport class AutofriendApi implements ICredentialType {\n\tname = 'autofriendApi';\n\tdisplayName = 'Autofriend API';\n\tproperties = [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tdisplayName: 'API Key',\n\t\t\tname: 'apiKey',\n\t\t\ttype: 'string' as NodePropertyTypes,\n\t\t\tdefault: '',\n\t\t},\n\t];\n}\n```\n\n4. Go to `/packages/nodes-base/package.json`.\n5. Paste `\"dist/credentials/AutofriendApi.credentials.js\",` in the credentials array to register the credentials (in an alphabetical order).\n6. Got to `packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.ts`.\n7. Associate the credentials with the node by adding the following to `description.credentials`.\n\n```typescript\n credentials: [\n\t  {\n\t\t  name: 'autofriendApi',\n\t\t  required: true,\n\t  },\n],\n```\n\n8. Stop the current n8n process by pressing `ctrl + c` in the terminal in which you are running n8n.\n9. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal.\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nWhen you go to the Node Editor view, you should see the following.\n\n![Autofriend's create credentials](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/autofriend-create-credentials.png)\n\n![Autofriend's credentials](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/autofriend-credentials.png)\n\n\n## Understanding the life cycle for the webhook method\n\nWhen a Trigger node is executed either in test or production mode, the following happens:\n\n### n8n persists all the webhooks defined in description.webhooks\n\nThe persisted data will be used later to verify if the incoming requests to the n8n's webhook endpoint are valid.\n\nThe property webhooks implements the interface **IWebhookDescription**. The interface has four properties.\n\n1. **name:** The property name where n8n will look for the life cycle methods.\n2. **httpMethod:** The HTTP method.\n3. **responseMode:** When the trigger will respond. When developing a trigger node, this property must be set to `onReceived`.\n4. **path:** The path added to the base URL.\n\nFor example, for a Trigger node with the following `webhooks` property, n8n will create the following webhooks URLs.\n\n```typescript\nwebhooks: [\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'default',\n\t\thttpMethod: 'POST',\n\t\tresponseMethod: 'onReceived',\n\t\tpath: 'webhook',\n\t},\n]\n```\n\n\n- **Test:** POST {{WEBHOOK_URL || localhost}}/webhook-test/{{uuid}}/{{path}}\n- **Production:** POST {{WEBHOOK_URL || localhost}}/webhook/{{uuid}}/{{path}}\n\n\nThese URLs can be found in the node under the `Webhook URLs` label.\n\nThese webhook URLs will be used as the notification URL (also known as the callback URL or target URL) when creating the webhook in the external system.\n\n**Note:** In test mode, the webhooks are persisted in memory. In production mode, they are persisted in the database.\n\n\n### n8n executes the life cycle methods\n\nThe life cycle methods allow us to create, delete, and check if the webhook exists in the external system.\n\n**Methods**\n\n- `checkExist`: This is the first method that gets called. It checks if the webhook with the current path is already registered in the external system or not. If the webhook is already registered, n8n persists the webhook ID. If the webhook isn't registered with the external system, the `create` method gets executed.\n- `create`: This method gets called if the `checkExist` method returns false (if the webhook with the current path doesn'texist in the external system). This method registers the webhook in the external system and stores the webhook ID in n8n.\n- `delete`: This method gets called when the trigger is either stopped manually or when the workflow is deactivated. It uses the ID previously persisted by either the create or the checkExist method to delete the webhook from the external system.\n\n![Lifecycle flowchart](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/lifecycle.png)\n\n\n### Wait for new events to trigger the workflow\n\nEvery time the external system notifies us about a change, by making an HTTP Request to the URL we previously registered in the `create` method, the `execute` method is called. Within this method, we have access to the request object and everything it contains. For example, body, headers, querystring, etc. The data the method returns is the data we want the rest of the workflow to have access to.\n\nLet's see how this would look for our current use-case:\n\n1. Go to `packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autofriend`, create a file named `GenericFunctions.ts`, and paste the following code.\n\n```typescript\nimport {\n\tIDataObject,\n\tIExecuteFunctions,\n\tIHookFunctions,\n\tILoadOptionsFunctions,\n\tIRequestOptions,\n\tIWebhookFunctions,\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\nexport async function autofriendApiRequest(this: IExecuteFunctions | IWebhookFunctions | IHookFunctions | ILoadOptionsFunctions, method: string, resource: string, body: any = {}, query: IDataObject = {}, uri?: string, option: IDataObject = {}): Promise<any> { // tslint:disable-line:no-any\n\n\tconst credentials = await this.getCredentials('autofriendApi') as IDataObject;\n\n\tconst apiKey = credentials.apiKey;\n\n\tconst endpoint = 'https://api2.autopilothq.com/v1';\n\n\tconst options: IRequestOptions = {\n\t\theaders: {\n\t\t\t'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n\t\t\tautopilotapikey: apiKey,\n\t\t},\n\t\tmethod,\n\t\tbody,\n\t\tqs: query,\n\t\turi: uri || `${endpoint}${resource}`,\n\t\tjson: true,\n\t};\n\tif (!Object.keys(body).length) {\n\t\tdelete options.body;\n\t}\n\tif (!Object.keys(query).length) {\n\t\tdelete options.qs;\n\t}\n\n\ttry {\n\t\treturn await this.helpers.request!(options);\n\t} catch (error) {\n\t\tif (error.response) {\n\t\t\tconst errorMessage = error.response.body.message || error.response.body.description || error.message;\n\t\t\tthrow new Error(`Autopilot error response [${error.statusCode}]: ${errorMessage}`);\n\t\t}\n\t\tthrow error;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n2. Go to `packages/nodes-base/nodes/AutofriendTrigger.node.ts` and add the following code after the property description.\n\n```typescript\n// @ts-ignore\nwebhookMethods = {\n\tdefault: {\n\t\tasync checkExists(this: IHookFunctions): Promise<boolean> {\n\t\t\tconst webhookData = this.getWorkflowStaticData('node');\n\t\t\tconst webhookUrl = this.getNodeWebhookUrl('default');\n\t\t\tconst event = this.getNodeParameter('event') as string;\n\t\t\tconst { hooks: webhooks } = await autofriendApiRequest.call(this, 'GET', '/hooks');\n\t\t\tfor (const webhook of webhooks) {\n\t\t\t\tif (webhook.target_url === webhookUrl && webhook.event === snakeCase(event)) {\n\t\t\t\t\twebhookData.webhookId = webhook.hook_id;\n\t\t\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\treturn false;\n\t\t},\n\t\tasync create(this: IHookFunctions): Promise<boolean> {\n\t\t\tconst webhookUrl = this.getNodeWebhookUrl('default');\n\t\t\tconst webhookData = this.getWorkflowStaticData('node');\n\t\t\tconst event = this.getNodeParameter('event') as string;\n\t\t\tconst body: IDataObject = {\n\t\t\t\tevent: snakeCase(event),\n\t\t\t\ttarget_url: webhookUrl,\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t\tconst webhook = await autofriendApiRequest.call(this, 'POST', '/hook', body);\n\t\t\twebhookData.webhookId = webhook.hook_id;\n\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t},\n\t\tasync delete(this: IHookFunctions): Promise<boolean> {\n\t\t\tconst webhookData = this.getWorkflowStaticData('node');\n\t\t\ttry {\n\t\t\t\tawait autofriendApiRequest.call(this, 'DELETE', `/hook/${webhookData.webhookId}`);\n\t\t\t} catch (error) {\n\t\t\t\treturn false;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tdelete webhookData.webhookId;\n\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t},\n\t},\n};\n}\n```\n3. Replace the `webhook` function with the following.\n```typescript\nasync webhook(this: IWebhookFunctions): Promise<IWebhookResponseData> {\n\tconst req = this.getRequestObject();\n\treturn {\n\t\tworkflowData: [\n\t\t\tthis.helpers.returnJsonArray(req.body),\n\t\t],\n};\n```\n4. In the same file, uncomment the code snippet on the top to import `autoFriendApiRequest` and `snakeCase`.\n5. Stop the current n8n process by pressing `ctrl + c` in the terminal where you are running n8n.\n6. Run the project using a tunnel by entering `./packages/cli/bin/n8n start --tunnel` in the terminal. Access the n8n Editor UI at [localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678/workflow).\n7. Enter the API key in the credentials. Instructions to find the API Key can be found [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/autopilot/).\n8. Go to the workflow editor, save your workflow, and execute the node.\n\n![Executed node](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/executed-node.png)\n\n9. Log into Autopilot and update a contact. Keep in mind that this should be done within two minutes after you executed the node. After that time frame, the webhook will be unregistered automatically and you will not be able to receive the event. If it takes you longer than that, please execute the node and update the contact again.\n\n![Executed node with results](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/executed-node-with-results.png)\n\nThe trigger node is now receiving events. Sometimes it might take a bit longer for the payload to arrive.\n\nYou probably noticed that this time we did not run the project using `npm run dev`, but instead using `./packages/cli/bin/n8n start --tunnel`.\n\nSince our server is running locally, we need a tool that lets us proxy all requests to our local machine so that n8n receives and handles the events from the external service (Autopilot). This gets achieved using a tunnel. The details on how a tunnel works are out of the scope of this tutorial. If you want to know about it, you can check this [link](http://localtunnel.github.io/www/). Keep in mind that the tunnel is meant for development purposes only and shouldn't be used in production.\n\n\n## Test your node\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/testing.md\"\n\n## Next steps\n\n* [Deploy your node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/).\n* View an example of a declarative node: n8n's [Brevo node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo){:target=_blank .external-link}.

    "item.md": "# `$item(index: number, runIndex?: number)`\n\nWith `$item` you can access the data of parent nodes. That can be the item data but also\nthe parameters. It expects as input an index of the item the data should be returned for. This is\nneeded because for each item the data returned can be different. This is probably straightforward for the\nitem data itself but maybe less for data like parameters. The reason why it is also needed, is\nthat they may contain an expression. Expressions get always executed of the context for an item.\nIf that would not be the case, for example, the Email Send node not would be able to send multiple\nemails at once to different people. Instead, the same person would receive multiple emails.\n\nThe index is 0 based. So `$item(0)` will return the first item, `$item(1)` the second one, and so on.\n\nBy default the item of the last run of the node  will be returned. So if the referenced node ran\n3x (its last runIndex is 2) and the current node runs the first time (its runIndex is 0) the\ndata of runIndex 2 of the referenced node will be returned.\n\nFor more information about what data can be accessed via `$node`, check out the `Variable: $node` [section](/code-examples/methods-variables/node/).\n\nExample:\n\n```typescript\n// Returns the value of the JSON data property \"myNumber\" of Node \"Set\" (first item)\nconst myNumber = $item(0).$node[\"Set\"].json[\"myNumber\"];\n// Like above but data of the 6th item\nconst myNumber = $item(5).$node[\"Set\"].json[\"myNumber\"];\n\n// Returns the value of the parameter \"channel\" of Node \"Slack\".\n// If it contains an expression the value will be resolved with the\n// data of the first item.\nconst channel = $item(0).$node[\"Slack\"].parameter[\"channel\"];\n// Like above but resolved with the value of the 10th item.\nconst channel = $item(9).$node[\"Slack\"].parameter[\"channel\"];\n```",

Build the node and copy to correct location: `n8n-node-dev build`\n    That command will build the JavaScript version of the node from the TypeScript code and copy it to the user folder where custom nodes get read from `~/.n8n/custom/`\n 1. Restart n8n and refresh the window so that the new node gets displayed\n\n\n## Create own custom n8n-nodes-module\n\nIf you want to create multiple custom nodes which are either:\n\n  - Only for yourself/your company\n  - Are only useful for a small number of people\n  - Require many or large dependencies\n\n!!! note\n    To learn how to develop and test n8n-nodes-module, refer to the [Create n8n-nodes-module](/integrations/creating-nodes/code/create-n8n-nodes-module/) documentation.\n\n\nIt is best to create your own `n8n-nodes-module` which can be installed separately.\nThat is an npm package that contains the nodes and is set up in a way\nthat n8n can automatically find and load them on startup.\n\nWhen creating such a module the following rules have to be followed that n8n\ncan automatically find the nodes in the module:\n\n  - The name of the module has to start with `n8n-nodes-`\n  - The `package.json` file has to contain a key `n8n` with the paths to nodes and credentials\n  - The module has to be installed alongside n8n\n\nAn example starter module which contains one node and credentials and implements\nthe above can be found here:\n\n[https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter)\n\n\n### Setup to use n8n-nodes-module\n\nTo use a custom `n8n-nodes-module`, it needs to be installed alongside n8n.\nFor example like this:\n\n```bash\n# Create folder for n8n installation\nmkdir my-n8n\ncd my-n8n\n\n# Install n8n\nnpm install n8n\n\n# Install custom nodes module\nnpm install n8n-nodes-my-custom-nodes\n\n# Start n8n\nn8n\n```\n\n\n### Development/Testing of custom n8n-nodes-module\n\nThis works in the same way as for any other npm module.\n\nExecute in the folder which contains the code of the custom `n8n-nodes-module`\nwhich should be loaded with n8n:\n\n```bash\n# Build the code\nnpm run build\n\n# \"Publish\" the package locally\nnpm link\n```\n\nThen in the folder in which n8n is installed:\n\n```bash\n# \"Install\" the above locally published module\nnpm link n8n-nodes-my-custom-nodes\n\n# Start n8n\nn8n\n```",
    "plan-flow-logic.md": "---\ndescription: Design your workflow's logic.\n---\n\n[TODO: I'm not sure this page is helpful, especially if focused on a dev audience]\n\n# Plan your workflow logic\n\nWhen you build a workflow, you create a set of instructions for how to process data. This can include:\n\n* Accessing external applications to retrieve and export data. \n* Manipulating data.\n* Performing different actions based on the data.\n\n\nTo define your data process, you link nodes together in a sequence. This is your workflow logic. n8n supports complex logic.\n\n///  Details  | What is data?\nIn n8n, data is any information processed by the workflow. n8n formats data as JSON. Refer to [Data](/data/) for more information on the data structure, and working with n8n workflow data.\n///\n## Fetch data\n\nYour workflow needs data. There are three main ways to get this data:\n\n* From the trigger node that starts the workflow. For example, if you use the Gmail trigger to start a workflow in response to an event in Gmail, the Gmail trigger node provides data about the event.\n* Using an app node to retrieve data. For example, you can use the Gmail node to fetch information from Gmail (after starting the workflow with a different trigger).\n* Generate the data within the workflow. For example, you can use the Code node to create data.\n\n\n## Manipulate data",

    "1-0-migration-checklist.md": "---\n#https://www.notion.so/n8n/Frontmatter-432c2b8dff1f43d4b1c8d20075510fe4\ntitle: n8n v1.0 migration guide\ndescription: What's new in version 1\ncontentType: reference\n---\n\n# n8n v1.0 migration guide\n\nThis document provides a summary of what you should be aware of before updating to version 1.0 of n8n.\n\nThe release of n8n 1.0 marks a milestone in n8n's journey to make n8n available for demanding production environments. Version 1.0 represents the hard work invested over the last four years to make n8n the most accessible, powerful, and versatile automation tool. n8n 1.0 is now ready for use in production.\n\n## New features\n\n### Python support in the Code node\n\nAlthough JavaScript remains the default language, you can now also select Python as an option in the [Code node](/code/code-node/) and even make use of [many Python modules](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide){:target=_blank .external link}. Note that Python is unavailable in Code nodes added to a workflow before v1.0.\n\n[PR #4295](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/4295){:target=_blank .external link}, [PR #6209](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6209){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n### Execution order\n\nn8n 1.0 introduces a new execution order for multi-branch workflows:\n\nIn multi-branch workflows, n8n needs to determine the order in which to execute nodes on branches. Previously, n8n executed the first node of each branch, then the second of each branch, and so on (breadth-first). The new execution order ensures that each branch executes completely before starting the next one (depth-first). Branches execute based on their position on the canvas, from top to bottom. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost one executes first.\n\nn8n used to execute multi-input nodes as long as they received data on their first input. Nodes connected to the second input of multi-input nodes automatically executed regardless of whether they received data. The new execution order introduced in n8n 1.0 simplifies this behavior: Nodes are now executed only when they receive data, and multi-input nodes require data on at least one of their inputs to execute.\n\nYour existing workflows will use the legacy order, while new workflows will execute using the v1 order. You can configure the execution order for each workflow in [workflow settings](/workflows/settings/).\n\n[PR #4238](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/4238){:target=_blank .external link}, [PR #6246](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6246){:target=_blank .external link}, [PR #6507](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6507){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n## Deprecations\n\n### MySQL and MariaDB\n\nn8n has removed support for MySQL and MariaDB as storage backends for n8n. These database systems are used by only a few users, yet they require continuous development and maintenance efforts. n8n recommends migrating to PostgreSQL for better compatibility and long-term support.\n\n[PR #6189](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6189){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n### EXECUTIONS_PROCESS and \"own\" mode\n\nPreviously, you could use the `EXECUTIONS_PROCESS` environment variable to specify whether executions should run in the `main` process or in their `own` processes. This option and `own` mode are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of n8n. This is because it led to increased code complexity while offering marginal benefits. Starting from n8n 1.0, `main` will be the new default.\n\nNote that executions start much faster in `main` mode than in `own` mode. However, if a workflow consumes more memory than is available, it might crash the entire n8n application instead of just the worker thread. To mitigate this, make sure to allocate enough system resources or configure [queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) to distribute executions among multiple workers.\n\n[PR #6196](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6196){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n### Docker\n\n#### Permissions change\n\nWhen using Docker-based deployments, the n8n process is now run by the user `node` instead of `root`. This change increases security.\n\nIf permission errors appear in your n8n container logs when starting n8n, you may need to update the permissions by executing the following command on the Docker host:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -it --user root -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n --entrypoint chown n8nio/base:16 -R node:node /home/node/.n8n\n```\n\n#### Image removal\n\nWe've removed the Debian and RHEL images. If you were using these you need to change the image you use. This shouldn't result in any errors unless you were making a custom image based on one of those images.\n\n#### Entrypoint change\n\nThe entrypoint for the container has changed and you no longer need to specify the n8n command. If you were previously running `n8n worker --concurrency=5` it's now `worker --concurrency=5`\n\n[PR #6365](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6365){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n### Workflow failures due to expression errors\n\nWorkflow executions may fail due to syntax or runtime errors in expressions, such as those that reference non-existent nodes. While expressions already throw errors on the frontend, this change ensures that n8n also throws errors on the backend, where they were previously silently ignored. To receive notifications of failing workflows, n8n recommends setting up an \"error workflow\" under workflow settings.\n\n[PR #6352](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6352){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n### Mandatory owner account\n\nThis change makes [User Management](/user-management/) mandatory and removes support for other authentication methods, such as BasicAuth and External JWT. Note that the number of permitted users on [n8n.cloud](http://n8n.cloud/){:target=_blank .external link} or custom plans still varies depending on your subscription.\n\n[PR #6362](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6362){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n### Directory for installing custom nodes\n\nn8n will no longer load custom nodes from its global `node_modules` directory. Instead, you must install (or link) them to `~/.n8n/custom` (or a directory defined by `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`). Custom nodes that are npm packages will be located in `~/.n8n/nodes`.\nIf you have custom nodes that were linked using `npm link` into the global `node_modules` directory, you need to link them again, into `~/.n8n/nodes` instead.\n\n[PR #6396](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6396){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n### WebSockets\n\nThe `N8N_PUSH_BACKEND` environment variable can be used to configure one of two available methods for pushing updates to the user interface: `sse` and `websocket`. Starting with n8n 1.0, `websocket` is the default method.\n\n[PR #6196](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6196){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n### Date transformation functions\n\nn8n provides various transformation functions that operate on dates. These functions may return either a JavaScript `Date` or a Luxon `DateTime` object. With the new behavior, the return type always matches the input. If you call a date transformation function on a `Date`, it returns a `Date`. Similarly, if you call it on a `DateTime` object, it returns a `DateTime` object.\n\nTo identify any workflows and nodes that might be impacted by this change, you can use this [utility workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1929-v1-helper-find-params-with-affected-expressions/){:target=_blank .external link}.\n\nFor more information about date transformation functions, please refer to the [official documentation](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/).\n\n[PR #6435](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6435){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n### Execution data retention\n\nStarting from n8n 1.0, all successful, failed, and manual workflow executions will be saved by default. These settings can be modified for each workflow under \"Workflow Settings,\" or globally using the respective environment variables. Additionally, the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` setting will be enabled by default, with `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` set to 10,000. These default settings are designed to prevent performance degradation when using SQLite. Make sure to configure them according to your individual requirements and system capacity.\n\n[PR #6577](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6577){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n### Removed N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB\n\nThe legacy `request` library has been deprecated for some time now. As of n8n 1.0, the ability to fall back to it in the HTTP Request node by setting the `N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB` environment variable has been fully removed. The HTTP Request node will now always use the new `HttpRequest` interface.\n\nIf you build custom nodes, refer to [HTTP request helpers](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/http-helpers/) for more information on migrating to the new interface.\n\n[PR #6413](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6413){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n### Removed WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL\n\nAs of version 0.227.0, n8n has renamed the `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` configuration option to `WEBHOOK_URL`. In n8n 1.0, `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` has been removed. Update your setup to reflect the new name. For more information about this configuration option, refer to [the docs](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/).\n\n[PR #1408](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/1408){:target=_blank .external link}\n\n### Remove Node 16 support\n\nn8n now requires Node 18.17.0 or above.\n\n## Updating to n8n 1.0\n\n1. Create a full backup of n8n.\n2. n8n recommends updating to the latest n8n 0.x release before updating to n8n 1.x. This will allow you to pinpoint any potential issues to the correct release. Once you have verified that n8n 0.x starts up without any issues, proceed to the next step.\n3. Carefully read the [Deprecations](#deprecations) and [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) sections above to assess how they may affect your setup.\n4. Update to n8n 1.0:\n\t* During beta (before July 24th 2023): If using Docker, pull the `next` Docker image.\n\t* After July 24th 2023: If using Docker, pull the `latest` Docker image.\n5. If you encounter any issues, redeploy the previous n8n version and restore the backup.\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nIf you encounter any issues during the process of updating to n8n 1.0, please seek help in the community [forum](https://community.n8n.io/){:target=_blank .external link}.\n\n## Thank you\n\nWe would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all of our users for their continued support and feedback. Your contributions are invaluable in helping us make n8n the best possible automation tool. We're excited to continue working with you as we move forward with the release of version 1.0 and beyond.

[Get in touch](mailto:license@n8n.io) for more information.\n///\n\nn8n's [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md){:target=\\_blank .external-link} and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md){:target=\\_blank .external-link} are based on the [fair-code](http://faircode.io) model.\n\n## License FAQs\n\n### What license do you use?\n\nn8n uses the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md){:target=_blank .external-link}. These licenses are based on the [fair-code](http://faircode.io) model.\n\n\n### What source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License? \n\nThe [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) applies to all our source code hosted in our [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) except:\n\n* Content of branches other than master.\n* Source code files that contain `.ee.` in their file name. These are licensed under the [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n### What is the Sustainable Use License?\n\nThe Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by n8n in 2022. You can read more about why we did this [here](#why-did-you-create-a-license). The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three limitations:\n\n* You may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use.\n* You may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes.\n* You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law.\n\nWe encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. Contact us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io) if you would like to ask any questions about it. \n\n\n### What is and isn't allowed under the license in the context of n8n's product?\n\nOur license restricts use to \"internal business purposes\". In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are selling a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from n8n functionality. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed:\n\n* White-labeling n8n and offering it to your customers for money.\n* Hosting n8n and charging people money to access it.\n\nAll of the following examples are allowed under our license: \n\n* Using n8n to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database.\n* Creating an n8n node for your product or any other integration between your product and n8n.\n* Providing consulting services related to n8n, for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to n8n, or code that gets executed by n8n.\n* Supporting n8n, for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server.\n\n#### Can I use n8n to act as the back-end to power a feature in my app?\n\nUsually yes, as long as the back-end process doesn't use users' own credentials to access their data.\n\nHere are two examples to clarify:\n\n##### Example 1: Sync ACME app with HubSpot\n\nBob sets up n8n to collect a user's HubSpot credentials to sync data in the ACME app with data in HubSpot.\n\n<span style=\"color: #BF2F51;\">**NOT ALLOWED**</span> under the Sustainable Use License. This use case collects the user's own HubSpot credentials to pull information to feed into the ACME app.\n\n##### Example 2: Embed AI chatbot in ACME app\n\nBob sets up n8n to embed an AI chatbot within the ACME app. The AI chatbot's credentials in n8n use Bob's company credentials. ACME app end-users only enter their questions or queries to the chatbot.\n\n<span style=\"color: #1C9985;\">**ALLOWED**</span> under the Sustainable Use License. No user credentials are being collected.\n\n### What if I want to use n8n for something that's not permitted by the license?\n\nYou must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed n8n within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to n8n for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use n8n Embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it [here](https://n8n.io/embed). \n\nIf you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).\n\n### Why don't you use an open source license?\n\nn8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make n8n as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs, and provide reliable software at scale long-term.\n\n### Why did you create a license?\n\nCreating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license:\n\n1. By using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible.\n2. By promoting [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours.\n\nOur goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were:\n\n1. To be as permissive as possible.\n2. Safeguarding our ability to build a business.\n3. Being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not.\n\n### My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use \u2013 can I still use n8n?\n\nProvided you are using n8n for internal business purposes, and not making n8n available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use n8n. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).\n\n\n### What happens to the code I contribute to n8n in light of the Sustainable Use License?\n\nAny code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's [terms of use](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#d-user-generated-content). In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms.\n\nn8n asks every contributor to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).\n\nIt's easy to get started contributing code to n8n [here](https://github.com/n8n-io), and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community [here](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/contributing.html).\n\n\n### Why did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?\n\nn8n was licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause until 17 March 2022. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license.\n\nHowever, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that's open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from n8n, so we wanted to remove this restriction.\n\nWe created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure n8n gets the funding needed to build and improve our product.\n\n### What are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?\n\nThere are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to \"sell\" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether.\n\nThat means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building n8n workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of n8n experts providing these services, you can learn more here.\n\n### Is n8n open source?\n\nAlthough n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), open source licenses can't include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, n8n offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source.\n\nWe coined the term ['fair-code'](https://faircode.io/) as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code.\n\n### What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it?\n\nFair-code isn't a software license. It describes a software model where software:\n\n* Is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody.\n* Has its source code openly available.\n* Can be extended by anybody in public and private communities.\n* Is commercially restricted by its authors.\n\nThe Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it and see other examples of fair-code licenses [here](https://faircode.io/).\n\nWe're always excited to talk about software licenses, fair-code, and other principles around sharing code with interested parties.

You'll build a chat workflow that uses ChatGPT and pulls in data from other n8n workflows.\ntype: tutorial\n---\n\n# Tutorial: Build an AI workflow in n8n\n\nThis tutorial introduces LangChain functionality in n8n. You can work through it with no prior knowledge of LangChain, AI, or n8n. However, if you've never used n8n before, you should also do the [Longer quickstart](/try-it-out/longer-introduction/), which introduces key n8n concepts.\n\n![\"Screenshot of the workflow\"](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-tutorial-outcome.png)\n\nIn this tutorial you will:\n\n* Create a workflow from scratch. It uses the Chat Trigger to simulate and test chat interactions, ChatGPT to power the chat functionality, and a custom tool to connect to other n8n workflows.\n* Understand key concepts, including:\n\t* The role of agents, models, and tools when building AI functionality.\n\t* Cluster nodes in n8n: groups of root and sub-node.\n\t* Loading your own data into AI workflows.\n\n## Step one: Sign up for n8n\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/try-it-out/install-run-n8n.md\"\n\n/// note | n8n version 1.21.0 or above\nThis tutorial requires n8n version 1.21.0 or above.\n///\n\n## Step two: Create a new workflow\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/try-it-out/new-workflow.md\"\n\n## Step three: Add a trigger node\n\nA trigger node starts a workflow. For this tutorial, use the [Chat Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/). This provides a chat interface that you can use to test the workflow.\n\n1. Select **Add first step**.\n1. Search for **Chat Trigger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n1. Select **Chat Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.\n1. Close the node details view to return to the canvas.\n\n## Step four: Add an agent\n\nAn agent takes an input, such as a user query, then uses a collection of tools to respond. In n8n the AI Agent node is a root node: a node whose behavior you can configure using sub-nodes.\n\n??? Details \"Cluster nodes: root and sub-nodes\"\n\t--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/cluster-nodes-summary.md\"\n\n1. Select the **Add node** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector. n8n opens the nodes panel.\n1. Search for **Agent**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n1. Select **AI Agent**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\n1. Close the node details view to return to the canvas.\n\n## Step five: Chat functionality\n\nTo provide chat interactions, the workflow needs:\n\n* A chat model, to process chat inputs and generate responses.\n* Memory, so that the workflow can remember and use previous sections of the chat.\n\nUse the connectors on the bottom of the AI Agent node to connect the following:\n\n* **Model**: OpenAI Chat Model. \n\tSet up the credentials for this node.\n\n\t??? Details \"Credential setup steps\"\n\t\t1. Create an account with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}. \n\t\t1. [Create API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys){:target=_blank .external-link}. \n\t\t1. In the OpenAI Chat Model node, select **Credential to connect with** > **Create New Credential** to open the credential modal.\n\t\t1. Paste the API key into **API Key**.\n\t\t1. Select **Save**. n8n tests the connection and confirms if the key is working.\n\t\t1. Close the credential modal.\n\n* **Memory**: Window Buffer Memory\n\n\n## Step six: Get data from another n8n workflow\n\nOne unique feature of AI in n8n is the ability to pull in data from other n8n workflows using the [Custom n8n Workflow Tool node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/). This means you can:\n\n* Load your own custom data\n* Create custom functionality in another workflow\n\nBecause n8n can connect to any service with a public API, this is a powerful tool.\n\nThis example generates some fake data in a workflow, and loads it in to the AI workflow. The AI workflow passes a parameter to the workflow generating the data, to ensure it only returns data that's intended to be public.\n\n1. Create a new workflow, then copy in this workflow JSON:\n\t```json\n\t{\n\t\t\"name\": \"Workflow tool example\",\n\t\t\"nodes\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"parameters\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"jsCode\": \"return [{\\\"fruit\\\": \\\"apple\\\", \\\"color\\\": \\\"green\\\", \\\"dataPrivacyLevel\\\": \\\"public\\\"},{\\\"fruit\\\": \\\"banana\\\", \\\"color\\\": \\\"yellow\\\", \\\"dataPrivacyLevel\\\": \\\"public\\\"},{\\\"fruit\\\": \\\"tomato\\\", \\\"color\\\": \\\"red\\\", \\\"dataPrivacyLevel\\\": \\\"private\\\"}]\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"4a30b74c-ed27-4668-8e68-c2e3a630ecd9\",\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"Code\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.code\",\n\t\t\t\"typeVersion\": 2,\n\t\t\t\"position\": [\n\t\t\t\t1180,\n\t\t\t\t500\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"parameters\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"conditions\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"string\": [\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"value1\": \"={{ $json.dataPrivacyLevel }}\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"value2\": \"={{ $('Execute Workflow Trigger').item.json.visibility  }}\"\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"eb479841-8099-4537-b89b-4b9867446688\",\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"Filter\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.filter\",\n\t\t\t\"typeVersion\": 1,\n\t\t\t\"position\": [\n\t\t\t\t1380,\n\t\t\t\t500\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"parameters\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"aggregate\": \"aggregateAllItemData\",\n\t\t\t\t\"include\": \"specifiedFields\",\n\t\t\t\t\"fieldsToInclude\": \"fruit, color\",\n\t\t\t\t\"options\": {}\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"6d6c847d-7417-4780-8a8b-b99996cd6166\",\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"Aggregate\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate\",\n\t\t\t\"typeVersion\": 1,\n\t\t\t\"position\": [\n\t\t\t\t1600,\n\t\t\t\t500\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"parameters\": {},\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"1ec54b09-7533-4280-8bf2-54407d6bf134\",\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"Execute Workflow Trigger\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger\",\n\t\t\t\"typeVersion\": 1,\n\t\t\t\"position\": [\n\t\t\t\t1000,\n\t\t\t\t500\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t],\n\t\t\"pinData\": {},\n\t\t\"connections\": {\n\t\t\t\"Code\": {\n\t\t\t\"main\": [\n\t\t\t\t[\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"node\": \"Filter\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"main\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"index\": 0\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"Filter\": {\n\t\t\t\"main\": [\n\t\t\t\t[\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"node\": \"Aggregate\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"main\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"index\": 0\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"Execute Workflow Trigger\": {\n\t\t\t\"main\": [\n\t\t\t\t[\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"node\": \"Code\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"main\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"index\": 0\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t```\n\tThe workflow uses the Code node to generate a sample data set, containing a list of fruits, their colors, and whether this information should be public or private.\n1. Copy the workflow ID from workflow URL. The ID is the group of random numbers and letters at the end of the URL.\n1. In the AI workflow, select the **Tool** output on the **AI Agent**. n8n opens the nodes panel.\n1. Select **Custom n8n Workflow Tool**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\n1. Configure the node parameters:\n\t* **Name**: `Fruit`\n\t* **Description**: `Call this tool to get a list of fruit.`\n\t* **Workflow ID**: Paste in the workflow ID that you copied from the example workflow URL.\n\t* **Field to Return**: `data`. This is the name of the item created in the Aggregate node in the example workflow.\n1. Select **Add Value** in **Workflow Values** to pass information to the workflow you're calling. Configure the value as follows:\n\t* **Name**: `visibility`\n\t* **Type**: String\n\t* **Value**: `public`\n\n\tn8n makes this value available to the workflow in the output data of the trigger node in the workflow you're calling. In this example, to access the value in an expression, use `{{ $('Execute Workflow Trigger').item.json.visibility }}`. You can see this in practice in the Filter node in the sample workflow.\n\n## Step seven: Test the workflow\n\nYou can now try out the workflow: close any open nodes, then select **Chat** to start talking with the AI. Ask `Please give me a list of fruits`. The AI Agent node executes the workflow you specified in **Workflow ID**, passing in the value of `visibility` from the **Workflow Values** field. The workflow generates some sample data, filters it to remove any items that aren't set to `public`, and returns the resulting data.\n\n## Next steps\n\n* Explore n8n using the [Quickstarts](/try-it-out/).\n* Learn more about AI concepts and view examples in [Examples and concepts](/advanced-ai/examples/introduction/).\n* Browse AI [Workflow templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/?categories=25){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n* Read [What product people need to know about LangChain](https://www.commandbar.com/blog/langchain-guide){:target=_blank .external-link} to learn more about AI concepts and terminology.",

Where a chain follows a predetermined sequence of calls to different AI components, an agent uses a language model to determine which actions to take.\n\nAgents are the part of AI that act as decision-makers. They can interact with other agents and tools. When you send a query to an agent, it tries to choose the best tools to use to answer. Agents adapt to your specific queries, as well as the prompts that configure their behavior.\n\n## Agents in n8n\n\nn8n provides one Agent node, which can act as different types of agent depending on the settings you choose. Refer to the [Agent node documentation](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) for details on the available agent types.\n\nWhen execute a workflow containing an agent, the agent runs multiple times. For example, it may do an initial setup, followed by a run to call a tool, then another run to evaluate the tool response and respond to the user.",

These components can include models and memory (though note that in n8n chains can't use memory).\n\n\n## Chains in n8n\n\nn8n provides three chain nodes:\n\n* [Basic LLM Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/): use to interact with an LLM, without any additional components.\n* [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): can connect to a vector store using a retriever, or to an n8n workflow using the Workflow Retriever node. Use this if you want to create a workflow that supports asking questions about specific documents.\n* [Summarization Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainsummarization/): takes an input and returns a summary.\n\nThere's an important difference between chains in n8n and in other tools such as LangChain: none of the chain nodes support memory. This means they can't remember previous user queries. If you use LangChain to code an AI application, you can give your application memory. In n8n, if you need your workflow to support memory, use an agent. This is essential if you want users to be able to have a natural ongoing conversation with your app.",

Learn what's special about tools in n8n.\ncontentType: explanation\n---\n\n# What's a tool in AI?\n\nIn AI, 'tools' has a specific meaning. Tools act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.\n\nHere are a couple of other ways of expressing it:\n\n> Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world ([source](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/){:target=_blank .external-link})\n\n<!--  -->\n\n> We can think of these tools as being almost like functions that your AI model can call ([source](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-and-langchain-the-complete-developers-masterclass/){:target=_blank .external-link})\n\n## AI tools in n8n\n\nn8n provides tool sub-nodes that you can connect to your AI agent. As well as providing some popular tools, such as [Wikipedia](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolwikipedia/) and [SerpAPI](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolserpapi/), n8n provides three especially powerful tools:\n\n* [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): use this to load any n8n workflow as a tool.\n* [Custom Code Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/): write code that your agent can run.\n* [HTTP Request Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/): make calls to fetch a website or data from an API.\n\nThe next three examples highlight the Custom n8n Workflow Tool:\n\n- [Chat with Google Sheets](/advanced-ai/examples/data-google-sheets/)\n- [Call an API to fetch data](/advanced-ai/examples/api-workflow-tool/)\n- [Set up a human fallback](/advanced-ai/examples/human-fallback/)\n\nYou can also learn how to [let AI dynamically specify parameters for tools with the `$fromAI()` function](/advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).",

Learn how n8n provides vector databases, along with the key components to work with them, including embeddings, retrievers, and document loaders.\ncontentType: explanation\n---\n\n# What are vector databases?\n\nVector databases store information as numbers:\n\n> A vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes. ([source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/vector-db){:target=_blank .external-link})\n\nThis enables fast and accurate similarity searches. With a vector database, instead of using conventional database queries, you can search for relevant data based on semantic and contextual meaning.\n\n## A simplified example\n\nA vector database could store the sentence \"n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host\", but instead of storing it as text, the vector database stores an array of dimensions (numbers between 0 and 1) that represent its features. This doesn't mean turning each letter in the sentence into a number. Instead, the vectors in the vector database describe the sentence. \n\nSuppose that in a vector store `0.1` represents `automation tool`, `0.2` represents `source available`, and `0.3` represents `can be self-hosted`. You could end up with the following vectors:\n\n| Sentence | Vector (array of dimensions) |\n| -------- | ------ |\n| n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host | [0.1, 0.2, 0.3] |\n| Zapier is an automation tool | [0.1] |\n| Make is an automation tool | [0.1] |\n| Confluence is a wiki tool that you can self-host | [0.3] |\n\n/// note | This example is very simplified\nIn practice, vectors are far more complex. A vector can range in size from tens to thousands of dimensions. The dimensions don't have a one-to-one relationship to a single feature, so you can't translate individual dimensions directly into single concepts. This example gives an approximate mental model, not a true technical understanding.\n///\n\n\n## Demonstrating the power of similarity search\n\nQdrant provide [vector search demos](https://qdrant.tech/demo/){:target=_blank .external-link} to help users understand the power of vector databases. The [food discovery demo](https://food-discovery.qdrant.tech/){:target=_blank .external-link} shows how a vector store can help match pictures based on visual similarities.\n\n> This demo uses data from Delivery Service. Users may like or dislike the photo of a dish, and the app will recommend more similar meals based on how they look. It's also possible to choose to view results from the restaurants within the delivery radius. ([source](https://qdrant.tech/demo/){:target=_blank .external-link})\n\nFor full technical details, refer to the [Qdrant demo-food-discovery GitHub repository](https://github.com/qdrant/demo-food-discovery){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n## Embeddings, retrievers, text splitters, and document loaders\n\nVector databases require other tools to function:\n\n- Document loaders and text splitters: document loaders pull in documents and data, and prepare them for embedding. Document loaders can use text splitters to break documents into chunks.\n- Embeddings: these are the tools that turn the data (text, images, and so on) into vectors, and back into raw data. Note that n8n only supports text embeddings.\n- Retrievers: retrievers fetch documents from vector databases. You need to pair them with an embedding to translate the vectors back into data.",

The AI model will fill in appropriate data given the context from the task and information from other connected tools.\n\n## How the `$fromAI()` function works\n\nThe `$fromAI()` function uses AI to dynamically fill in parameters for tools connected to the [Tools AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).  You can use the `$fromAI()` function in expressions within [app nodes](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) (like [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/), [Notion](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/), or [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/)) connected to a tool node.\n\n/// note | Only for the Node Tools\nThe `$fromAI()` function is only available for [app node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) tools connected to the Tools Agent. It isn't possible to use the `$fromAI()` function with the [Call n8n Workflow](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/), [Code](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/), [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/), or [other cluster sub-nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/).\n///\n\nTo use the `$fromAI()` function, call it with the required `key` parameter:\n\n```javascript\n{{ $fromAI('email') }}\n```\n\nThe `key` parameter and other arguments to the `$fromAI()` function aren't references to existing values. Instead, think of these arguments as hints that the AI model will use to populate the right data.\n\nFor instance, if you choose a key called `email`, the AI Model will look for an email address in its context, other tools, and input data. In chat workflows, it may ask the user for an email address if it can't find one elsewhere. You can optionally pass other parameters like `description` to give extra context to the AI model.\n\n## Parameters\n\nThe `$fromAI()` function accepts the following parameters:\n\n<!-- vale off -->\n\n| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |\n| --------- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |\n| `key` | string | :white_check_mark: | A string representing the key or name of the argument. This must be between 1 and 64 characters in length and can only contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. |\n| `description` | string | :x: | A string describing the argument. |\n| `type` | string | :x: | A string specifying the data type. Can be string, number, boolean, or json (defaults to string). |\n| `defaultValue` | any | :x: | The default value to use for the argument. |\n\n<!-- vale on -->\n\n## Examples\n\nAs an example, you could use the following `$fromAI()` expression to dynamically populate a field with a name:\n\n```javascript\n$fromAI(\"name\", \"The commenter's name\", \"string\", \"Jane Doe\")\n```\n\nIf you don't need the optional parameters, you could simplify this as:\n\n```javascript\n$fromAI(\"name\")\n```\n\nTo dynamically populate the number of items you have in stock, you could use a `$fromAI()` expression like this:\n\n```javascript\n$fromAI(\"numItemsInStock\", \"Number of items in stock\", \"number\", 5)\n```\n\n## Templates\n\nYou can see the `$fromAI()` function in action in the following templates:\n\n* [Angie, Personal AI Assistant with Telegram Voice and Text](https://n8n.io/workflows/2462-angie-personal-ai-assistant-with-telegram-voice-and-text/)\n* [Automate Customer Support Issue Resolution using AI Text Classifier](https://n8n.io/workflows/2468-automate-customer-support-issue-resolution-using-ai-text-classifier/)\n* [Scale Deal Flow with a Pitch Deck AI Vision, Chatbot and QDrant Vector Store](https://n8n.io/workflows/2464-scale-deal-flow-with-a-pitch-deck-ai-vision-chatbot-and-qdrant-vector-store/)",

This page provides some example configurations, including using the [HTTP node variables](/code/builtin/http-node-variables/).\n\nRefer to [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) for more information on the node.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/http/pagination-api-differences.md\"\n\n\n## Enable pagination\n\nIn the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Pagination**.\n\n## Use a URL from the response to get the next page using `$response`\n\nIf the API returns the URL of the next page in its response:\n\n1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Response Contains Next URL**. n8n displays the parameters for this option.\n1. In **Next URL**, use an expression to set the URL. The exact expression depends on the data returned by your API. For example, if the API includes a parameter called `next-page` in the response body:\n\t```javascript\n\t{{ $response.body[\"next-page\"] }}\n\t```\n\n## Get the next page by number using `$pageCount`\n\nIf the API you're using supports targeting a specific page by number:\n\n1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.\n1. Set **Type** to **Query**.\n1. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API and is usually described in its documentation. For example, some APIs use a query parameter named `page` to set the page. So **Name** would be `page`.\n1. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.\n1. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`\n\n`$pageCount` is the number of pages the HTTP Request node has fetched. It starts at zero. Most API pagination counts from one (the first page is page one). This means that adding `+1` to `$pageCount` means the node fetches page one on its first loop, page two on its second, and so on.\n\n## Navigate pagination through body parameters\n\nIf the API you're using allows you to paginate through the body parameters:\n\n1. Set the HTTP Request Method to **POST**\n1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.\n1. Select **Body** in the **Type** parameter.\n1. Enter the **Name** of the body parameter. This depends on the API you're using. `page` is a common key name.\n1. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.\n1. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`\n\n## Set the page size in the query\n\nIf the API you're using supports choosing the page size in the query:\n\n1. Select **Send Query Parameters** in main node parameters (this is the parameters you see when you first open the node, not the settings within options).\n1. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API. For example, a lot of APIs use a query parameter named `limit` to set page size. So **Name** would be `limit`.\n1. In **Value**, enter your page size.",

It's available for all self-hosted pricing tiers.\n///\n\nThe n8n API comes with a built-in Swagger UI playground in self-hosted versions. This provides interactive documentation, where you can try out requests. The path to access the playground depends on your hosting.\n\nn8n constructs the path from values set in your environment variables:\n\n```shell\nN8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/docs\n```\n\nThe API version number is `1`. There may be multiple versions available in the future.\n\n/// warning | Real data\nIf you select **Authorize** and enter your API key in the API playground, you have access to your live data. This is useful for trying out requests. Be aware you can change or delete real data.\n///\nThe API includes built-in documentation about credential formats. This is available using the `credentials` endpoint:\n\n```shell\nN8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/credentials/schema/{credentialTypeName}\n```\n\n/// note | How to find `credentialTypeName`\nTo find the type, download your workflow as JSON and examine it. For example, for a Google Drive node the `{credentialTypeName}` is `googleDriveOAuth2Api`:\n```json\n{\n    ...,\n    \"credentials\": {\n        \"googleDriveOAuth2Api\": {\n        \"id\": \"9\",\n        \"name\": \"Google Drive\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n///",

    "ai-code.md": "---\n#https://www.notion.so/n8n/Frontmatter-432c2b8dff1f43d4b1c8d20075510fe4\ntitle: AI coding\ndescription: Use GPT to generate code in the Code node.\ncontentType: explanation\n---\n\n# AI coding with GPT\n\nNot available on self-hosted.  \n\nPython isn't supported.\n///\n\n## Use AI in the Code node\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/code/ai-how-to.md\"\n\n## Usage limits\n\nDuring the trial phase there are no usage limits. If n8n makes the feature permanent, there may be usage limits as part of your pricing tier.\n\n## Feature limits\n\nThe ChatGPT implementation in n8n has the following limitations:\n\n* The AI writes code that manipulates data from the n8n workflow. You can't ask it to pull in data from other sources.\n* The AI doesn't know your data, just the schema, so you need to tell it things like how to find the data you want to extract, or how to check for null.\n* Nodes before the Code node must execute and deliver data to the Code node before you run your AI query.\n* Doesn't work with large incoming data schemas.\n* May have issues if there are a lot of nodes before the code node.\n\n## Writing good prompts\n\n<!-- vale off -->\n\nWriting good prompts increases the chance of getting useful code back.\n\nSome general tips:\n\n* Provide examples: if possible, give a sample expected output. This helps the AI to better understand the transformation or logic you\u2019re aiming for.\n* Describe the processing steps: if there are specific processing steps or logic that should apply to the data, list them in sequence. For example: \"First, filter out all users under 18. Then, sort the remaining users by their last name.\"\n* Avoid ambiguities: while the AI understands various instructions, being clear and direct ensures you get the most accurate code. Instead of saying \"Get the older users,\" you might say \"Filter users who are 60 years and above.\"\n* Be clear about what you expect as the output. Do you want the data transformed, filtered, aggregated, or sorted? Provide as much detail as possible.\n\nAnd some n8n-specific guidance:\n\n* Think about the input data: make sure ChatGPT knows which pieces of the data you want to access, and what the incoming data represents. You may need to tell ChatGPT about the availability of n8n's built-in methods and variables.\n* Declare interactions between nodes: if your logic involves data from multiple nodes, specify how they should interact. \"Merge the output of 'Node A' with 'Node B' based on the 'userID' property\". if you prefer data to come from certain nodes or to ignore others, be clear: \"Only consider data from the 'Purchases' node and ignore the 'Refunds' node.\"\n* Ensure the output is compatible with n8n. Refer to [Data structure](/data/data-structure/) for more information on the data structure n8n requires.\n\n### Example prompts\n\nThese examples show a range of possible prompts and tasks.\n\n#### Example 1: Find a piece of data inside a second dataset\n\nTo try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/find-a-piece-of-data.json) and import it into n8n.\n\nIn the third Code node, enter this prompt:\n\n> The slack data contains only one item. The input data represents all Notion users. Sometimes the person property that holds the email can be null. I want to find the notionId of the Slack user and return it.\n\nTake a look at the code the AI generates.\n\nThis is the JavaScript you need:\n\n```js\nconst slackUser = $(\"Mock Slack\").all()[0];\nconst notionUsers = $input.all();\nconst slackUserEmail = slackUser.json.email;\n\nconst notionUser = notionUsers.find(\n  (user) => user.json.person && user.json.person.email === slackUserEmail\n);\n\nreturn notionUser ? [{ json: { notionId: notionUser.json.id } }] : [];\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Data transformation\n\nTo try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/data-transformation.json) and import it into n8n.\n\nIn the **Join items** Code node, enter this prompt:\n\n> Return a single line of text that has all usernames listed with a comma. Each username should be enquoted with a double quotation mark.\n\nTake a look at the code the AI generates.\n\nThis is the JavaScript you need:\n\n```js\nconst items = $input.all();\nconst usernames = items.map((item) => `\"${item.json.username}\"`);\nconst result = usernames.join(\", \");\nreturn [{ json: { usernames: result } }];\n```\n\n#### Example 3: Summarize data and create a Slack message\n\nTo try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/summarize-data.json) and import it into n8n.\n\nIn the **Summarize** Code node, enter this prompt:\n\n> Create a markdown text for Slack that counts how many ideas, features and bugs have been submitted. The type of submission is saved in the property_type field. A feature has the property \"Feature\", a bug has the property \"Bug\" and an idea has the property \"Bug\". Also, list the five top submissions by vote in that message. Use \"<url|text>\" as markdown for links.\n\nTake a look at the code the AI generates.\n\nThis is the JavaScript you need:\n\n```js\nconst submissions = $input.all();\n\n// Count the number of ideas, features, and bugs\nlet ideaCount = 0;\nlet featureCount = 0;\nlet bugCount = 0;\n\nsubmissions.forEach((submission) => {\n  switch (submission.json.property_type[0]) {\n    case \"Idea\":\n      ideaCount++;\n      break;\n    case \"Feature\":\n      featureCount++;\n      break;\n    case \"Bug\":\n      bugCount++;\n      break;\n  }\n});\n\n// Sort submissions by votes and take the top 5\nconst topSubmissions = submissions\n  .sort((a, b) => b.json.property_votes - a.json.property_votes)\n  .slice(0, 5);\n\nlet topSubmissionText = \"\";\ntopSubmissions.forEach((submission) => {\n  topSubmissionText += `<${submission.json.url}|${submission.json.name}> with ${submission.json.property_votes} votes\\n`;\n});\n\n// Construct the Slack message\nconst slackMessage = `*Summary of Submissions*\\n\nIdeas: ${ideaCount}\\n\nFeatures: ${featureCount}\\n\nBugs: ${bugCount}\\n\nTop 5 Submissions:\\n\n${topSubmissionText}`;\n\nreturn [{ json: { slackMessage } }];\n```\n\n<!-- vale on -->\n\n### Reference incoming node data explicitly\n\nIf your incoming data contains nested fields, using dot notation to reference them can help the AI understand what data you want.\n\n![\"Screenshot of an n8n code node, highlighting how to reference data with dot notation in an AI query\"](/_images/code/ai-code/reference-data-dot-notation.png)\n\nTo try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/reference-incoming-data-explicitly.json) and import it into n8n.\n\nIn the second Code node, enter this prompt:\n\n> The data in \"Mock data\" represents a list of people. For each person, return a new item containing personal_info.first_name and work_info.job_title.\n\nThis is the JavaScript you need:\n\n```js\nconst items = $input.all();\nconst newItems = items.map((item) => {\n  const firstName = item.json.personal_info.first_name;\n  const jobTitle = item.json.work_info.job_title;\n  return {\n    json: {\n      firstName,\n      jobTitle,\n    },\n  };\n});\nreturn newItems;\n```\n\n### Related resources\n\nPluralsight offer a short guide on [How to use ChatGPT to write code](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/how-use-chatgpt-programming-coding){:target=_blank .external-link}, which includes example prompts.\n\n\n\n## Fixing the code\n\nThe AI-generated code may work without any changes, but you may have to edit it. You need to be aware of n8n's [Data structure](/data/data-structure/). You may also find n8n's built-in methods and variables useful.",
    "code-node.md": "Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.\n\n/// note | Coding in n8n\nThis page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the [Code](/code/) section. It includes:\n\n* Reference documentation on [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/)\n* Guidance on [Handling dates](/code/cookbook/luxon/) and [Querying JSON](/code/cookbook/jmespath/)\n* A growing collection of examples in the [Cookbook](/code/cookbook/)\n///\n\n/// note | Examples and templates\nFor usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Code integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/code/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.\n///\n\n/// note | Function and Function Item nodes\nThe Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Function node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function.md){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Function Item node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.functionItem.md){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n///\n## Usage\n\nHow to use the Code node.\n\n### Choose a mode\n\nThere are two modes:\n\n* **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.\n* **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.\n\n## JavaScript\n\nThe Code node supports Node.js.\n\n### Supported JavaScript features\n\nThe Code node supports:\n\n* Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.\n* Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.\n\n### External libraries\n\nIf you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.\n\nIf you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:\n\n* [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html){:target=_blank .external-link}\n* [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment){:target=_blank .external-link}\n\n### Built-in methods and variables\n\nn8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.\n\nThe syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.\n\n\n## Python\n\nn8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/){:target=_blank .external-link}, which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide){:target=_blank .external-link}. n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.\n\n/// note | Slower than JavaScript\nThe Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.\n///\n### Built-in methods and variables\n\nn8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.\n\nThe syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.\n\n## File system and HTTP requests\n\nYou can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:\n\n* [Read/Write File From Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)\n* [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)\n\n## Coding in n8n\n\nThere are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.\n\n### Key concepts\n\nWhen working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:\n\n* [Data structure](/data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.\n* [Item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.\n\n### Built-in methods and variables\n\nn8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:\n\n* Accessing specific item data\n* Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment\n* Convenience variables to help with data and time\n\nRefer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview) for more information.\n\n\n\n## Use AI in the Code node\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/code/ai-how-to.md\"",

Refer to [Data](/data/) for more information on working with data in your workflows.\n///\n## Writing expressions\n\n\nTo use an expression to set a parameter value:\n\n1. Hover over the parameter where you want to use an expression.\n2. Select **Expressions** in the **Fixed/Expression** toggle.\n3. Write your expression in the parameter, or select **Open expression editor** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Open expressions editor icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the expressions editor. If you use the expressions editor, you can browse the available data in the **Variable selector**. All expressions have the format `{{ your expression here }}`.\n\n\n### Example: Get data from webhook body\n\nConsider the following scenario: you have a webhook trigger that receives data through the webhook body. You want to extract some of that data for use in the workflow.\n\nYour webhook data looks similar to this:\n\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"host\": \"n8n.instance.address\",\n      ...\n    },\n    \"params\": {},\n    \"query\": {},\n    \"body\": {\n      \"name\": \"Jim\",\n      \"age\": 30,\n      \"city\": \"New York\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n\nIn the next node in the workflow, you want to get just the value of `city`. You can use the following expression:\n\n\n```js\n{{$json.body.city}}\n```\n\nThis expression:\n\n1. Accesses the incoming JSON-formatted data using n8n's custom `$json` variable.\n2. Finds the value of `city` (in this example, \"New York\"). Note that this example uses JMESPath syntax to query the JSON data. You can also write this expression as `{{$json['body']['city']}}`.\n\n\n### Example: Writing longer JavaScript\n\nAn expression contains one line of JavaScript. This means you cannot do things like variable assignments or multiple standalone operations.\n\nTo understand the limitations of JavaScript in expressions, and start thinking about workarounds, look at the following two pieces of code. Both code examples use the Luxon date and time library to find the time between two dates in months, and encloses the code in handlebar brackets, like an expression. \n\nHowever, the first example isn't a valid n8n expression:\n\n\n```js\n// This example is split over multiple lines for readability\n// It's still invalid when formatted as a single line\n{{\n  function example() {\n    let end = DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13');\n    let start = DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13');\n    let diffInMonths = end.diff(start, 'months');\n    return diffInMonths.toObject();\n  }\n  example();\n}}\n```\n\n\nWhile the second example is valid:\n\n\n```js\n{{DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13'), 'months').toObject()}}\n```\n\n## Common issues\n\nFor common errors or issues with expressions and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](/code/cookbook/expressions/common-issues/).",

For full details of how to use JMESPath, refer to the [JMESPath documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n\n## The `jmespath()` method\n\nn8n provides a custom method, `jmespath()`. Use this method to perform a search on a JSON object using the JMESPath query language.\n\nThe basic syntax is: \n\n=== \"JavaScript\"\n\t```js\n\t$jmespath(object, searchString)\n\t```\n=== \"Python\"\n\t```python\n\t_jmespath(object, searchString)\n\t```\n\n\nTo help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent longer JavaScript:\n\n\n```js\nvar jmespath = require('jmespath');\njmespath.search(object, searchString);\n```\n\n/// note | Expressions must be single-line\nThe longer code example doesn't work in Expressions, as they must be single-line.\n///\n\n`object` is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. `searchString` is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification){:target=_blank .external-link} provides a list of supported expressions, while their [Tutorial](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html) and [Examples](https://jmespath.org/examples.html){:target=_blank .external-link} provide interactive examples.\n\n/// warning | Search parameter order\nThe examples in the [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification){:target=_blank .external-link} follow the pattern `search(searchString, object)`. The [JMESPath JavaScript library](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.js/){:target=_blank .external-link}, which n8n uses, supports `search(object, searchString)` instead. This means that when using examples from the JMESPath documentation, you may need to change the order of the search function parameters.\n///\n\n## Common tasks\n\nThis section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [JMESPath's own documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\nWhen trying out these examples, you need to set the Code node **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item**.\n\n### Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections\n\nFrom the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections){:target=_blank .external-link}:\n\n> Projections are one of the key features of JMESPath. Use it to apply an expression to a collection of elements. JMESPath supports five kinds of projections:\n> \n> * List Projections\n> * Slice Projections\n> * Object Projections\n> * Flatten Projections\n> * Filter Projections\n\nThe following example shows basic usage of list, slice, and object projections. Refer to the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections){:target=_blank .external-link} for detailed explanations of each projection type, and more examples.\n\nGiven this JSON from a webhook node:\n\n\n```js\n[\n  {\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"host\": \"n8n.instance.address\",\n      ...\n    },\n    \"params\": {},\n    \"query\": {},\n

For full details of how to use Luxon, refer to [Luxon's documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon){:target=_blank .external-link}. \n\nn8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon makes this easier.\n\n/// note | Python support\nLuxon is a JavaScript library. The two convenience [variables](#variables) created by n8n are available when using Python in the Code node, but their functionality is limited:\n\n* You can't perform Luxon operations on these variables. For example, there is no Python equivalent for `$today.minus(...)`.\n* The generic Luxon functionality, such as [Convert date string to Luxon](#convert-date-string-to-Luxon), isn't available for Python users.\n///\t\n\n\n## Variables\n\nn8n uses Luxon to provide two custom variables:\n\n- `now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to `DateTime.now()`.\n- `today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 })`.\n\nNote that these variables can return different time formats when cast as a string. This is the same behavior as Luxon's `DateTime.now()`.\n\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t``` js\n\t{{$now}}\n\t// n8n displays the ISO formatted timestamp\n\t// For example 2022-03-09T14:02:37.065+00:00\n\t{{\"Today's date is \" + $now}}\n\t// n8n displays \"Today's date is <unix timestamp>\"\n\t// For example \"Today's date is 1646834498755\"\n\t```\n\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t``` js\n\t$now\n\t// n8n displays <ISO formatted timestamp>\n\t// For example 2022-03-09T14:00:25.058+00:00\n\tlet rightNow = \"Today's date is \" + $now\n\t// n8n displays \"Today's date is <unix timestamp>\"\n\t// For example \"Today's date is 1646834498755\"\n\t```\n=== \"Code node (Python)\"\n\t``` python\n\t_now\n\t# n8n displays <ISO formatted timestamp>\n\t# For example 2022-03-09T14:00:25.058+00:00\n\trightNow = \"Today's date is \" + str(_now)\n\t# n8n displays \"Today's date is <unix timestamp>\"\n\t# For example \"Today's date is 1646834498755\"\n\t```\n\nn8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.\n\n## Date and time behavior in n8n\n\nBe aware of the following:\n\n* In a workflow, n8n converts dates and times to strings between nodes. Keep this in mind when doing arithmetic on dates and times from other nodes.\n* With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\")`.\n\n## Setting the timezone in n8n\n\nLuxon uses the n8n timezone. This value is either:\n\n* Default: `America/New York`\n* A custom timezone for your n8n instance, set using the `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable.\n* A custom timezone for an individual workflow, configured in workflow settings.\n\n## Common tasks\n\nThis section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [Luxon's own documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link}.\n\n\n### Convert date string to Luxon\n\nYou can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings.\n\n/// note | A difference between Luxon DateTime and JavaScript Date\nWith vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\")`.\n///\n#### If you have a date in a supported standard technical format: \n\nMost dates use `fromISO()`. This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example:\n\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\t{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')}}\n\t```\n\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\tlet luxonDateTime = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')\n\t```\n\n\nLuxon's API documentation has more information on [fromISO](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimefromiso){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link}.\n\nLuxon provides functions to handle conversions for a range of formats. Refer to Luxon's guide to [Parsing technical formats](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=parsing-technical-formats) for details.\n\n#### If you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format: \n\nUse Luxon's [Ad-hoc parsing](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=ad-hoc-parsing){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link}. To do this, use the `fromFormat()` function, providing the string and a set of [tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=table-of-tokens){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} that describe the format.\n\nFor example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as `23-06-2019`. You want to turn this into a Luxon object:\n\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\t{{DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\")}}\n\t```\n\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\tlet newFormat = DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\")\n\t```\n\nWhen using ad-hoc parsing, note Luxon's warning about [Limitations](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=limitations){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link}. If you see unexpected results, try their [Debugging](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=debugging){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} guide.\n\n### Get n days from today\n\nGet a number of days before or after today. \n\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n\n\tFor example, you want to set a field to always show the date seven days before the current date.\n\n\tIn the expressions editor, enter:\n\n\n\t``` js\n\t{{$today.minus({days: 7})}}\n\t```\n\n\tOn the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: \"2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00\"]`.\n\n\tThis example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.\n\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\n\n\tFor example, you want a variable containing the date seven days before the current date.\n\n\tIn the code editor, enter:\n\n\t``` js\n\tlet sevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7})\n\t```\n\n\tOn the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: \"2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00\"]`.\n\n\tThis example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.\n\nFor more detailed information and examples, refer to:\n\n* Luxon's [guide to math](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math)\n* Their API documentation on [DateTime plus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeplus) and [DateTime minus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeminus)\n\n### Create human-readable dates\n\nIn [Get n days from today](#get-n-days-from-today), the example gets the date seven days before the current date, and returns it as `[Object: \"yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00\"]` (for expressions) or `yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00` (in the Code node). To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions.\n\nFor example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY, so that on the 23rd June 2019, it returns `23/06/2019`.\n\nThis expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format.\n\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\t{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()}}\n\t```\n\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\tlet readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()\n\t```\n\nYou can alter the format. For example:\n\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\t{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})}}\n\t```\n\n\tOn 23rd June 2019, this returns \"16 June 2019\".\n\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\tlet readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})\n\t```\n\n\tOn 23rd June 2019, this returns \"16 June 2019\".\n\nRefer to Luxon's guide on [toLocaleString (strings for humans)](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting?id=tolocalestring-strings-for-humans){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} for more information.\n\n\n### Get the time between two dates\n\nTo get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration.\n\nFor example, get the number of months between two dates:\n\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\t{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()}}\n\t```\n\n\tThis returns `[Object: {\"months\":1}]`.\n\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\tlet monthsBetweenDates = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()\n\t```\n\n\tThis returns `{\"months\":1}`.\n\nRefer to Luxon's [Diffs](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math?id=diffs){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.\n\n### A longer example: How many days to Christmas?\n\nThis example brings together several Luxon features, uses JMESPath, and does some basic string manipulation. \n\nThe scenario: you want a countdown to 25th December. Every day, it should tell you the number of days remaining to Christmas. You don't want to update it for next year - it needs to seamlessly work for every year.\n\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\t{{\"There are \" + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + \" days to Christmas!\"}}\n\t```\n\n\tThis outputs `\"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!\"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs \"There are 291 days to Christmas!\".\n\n\tA detailed explanation of what the expression does:\n\n\t* `{{`: indicates the start of the expression.\n\t* `\"There are \"`: a string. \n\t* `+`: used to join two strings.\n\t* `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in [Get the time between two dates](#get-the-time-between-two-dates), but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.\n\t* `DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days'`: this part gets the current year using `$today.year`, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.\n\t* `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {\"days\":-<number-of-days>}]`. For example, on 9th March, `[Object: {\"days\":-291}]`.\n\t* `.days` uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our [JMESpath](/code/cookbook/jmespath/) documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.\n\t* `.toString().substring(1)` turns the number into a string and removes the `-`.\n\t* `+ \" days to Christmas!\"`: another string, with a `+` to join it to the previous string.\n\t* `}}`: indicates the end of the expression.\n\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\n\n\t```js\n\tlet daysToChristmas = \"There are \" + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + \" days to Christmas!\";\n\t```\n\n\tThis outputs `\"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!\"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs \"There are 291 days to Christmas!\".\n\n\tA detailed explanation of what the code does:\n\n\t* `\"There are \"`: a string. \n\t* `+`: used to join two strings.\n\t* `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in [Get the time between two dates](#get-the-time-between-two-dates), but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.\n\t* `DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days'`: this part gets the current year using `$today.year`, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.\n\t* `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {\"days\":-<number-of-days>}]`.

This is useful if you need to retrieve linked items from further back than the immediate previous node.\n\nTo access the linked items from earlier in the workflow, use `(\"<node-name>\").itemMatching(currentNodeinputIndex)`.\n\n\nFor example, consider a workflow that does the following:\n\n1.

The nodes allow you to access (extract) data from multiple disparate sources, modify (transform) that data in a particular way, and pass (load) it along to where it needs to be.\n\nThe data that moves along from node to node in your workflow must be in a format (structure) that can be recognized and interpreted by each node. In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects.\n\n/// note | About array of objects\nAn array is a list of values. The array can be empty or contain several elements. Each element is stored at a position (index) in the list, starting at 0, and can be referenced by the index number. For example, in the array `[\"Leonardo\", \"Michelangelo\", \"Donatello\", \"Raphael\"];` the element `Donatello` is stored at index 2.\n\nAn object stores key-value pairs, instead of values at numbered indexes as in arrays. The order of the pairs isn't important, as the values can be accessed by referencing the key name. For example, the object below contains two properties (`name` and `color`):\n\n```json\n{\n\tname: 'Michelangelo',\n\tcolor: 'blue',\n}\n```\n\nAn array of objects is an array that contains one or more objects. For example, the array `turtles` below contains four objects:\n\n```javascript\nvar turtles = [\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'Michelangelo',\n\t\tcolor: 'orange',\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'Donatello',\n\t\tcolor: 'purple',\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'Raphael',\n\t\tcolor: 'red',\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'Leonardo',\n\t\tcolor: 'blue',\n\t}\n];\n```\n\nYou can access the properties of an object using dot notation with the syntax `object.property`. For example, `turtles[1].color` gets the color of the second turtle.\n///\n\n\nData sent from one node to another is sent as an array of JSON objects. The elements in this collection are called items.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/explanation_items.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Items</i></figcaption></figure>\n\nAn n8n node performs its action on each item of incoming data.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Items in the Customer Datastore node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n## Creating data sets with the Code node\n\nNow that you are familiar with the n8n data structure, you can use it to create your own data sets or simulate node outputs. To do this, use the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/){:target=\"_blank\"} to write JavaScript code defining your array of objects with the following structure:\n\n```javascript\nreturn [\n\t{\n\t\tjson: {\n\t\t\tapple: 'beets',\n\t\t}\n\t}\n];\n```\n\nFor example, the array of objects representing the Ninja turtles would look like this in the Code node:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function_notnested.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Array of objects in the Code node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n/// warning | JSON objects\nNotice that this array of objects contains an extra key: `json`. n8n expects you to wrap each object in an array in another object, with the key `json`.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/explanation_datastructure.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Illustration of data structure in n8n</i></figcaption></figure>\n\nIt's good practice to pass the data in the right structure used by n8n. But don't worry if you forget to add the `json` key to an item, n8n (version 0.166.0 and above) adds it automatically.\n///\n\nYou can also have nested pairs, for example if you want to define a primary and a secondary color. In this case, you need to further wrap the key-value pairs in curly braces `{}`.\n\n/// note | n8n data structure video\n[This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQHT3Unn4tY) offers a more detailed explanation of data structure in n8n.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQHT3Unn4tY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n///\n\n\n### Exercise\n\nIn a Code node, create an array of objects named `myContacts` that contains the properties `name` and `email`, and the `email` property is further split into `personal` and `work`.\n\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n\n\tIn the **Code node**, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:\n\n\t```javascript\n\tvar myContacts = [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tjson: {\n\t\t\t\tname: 'Alice',\n\t\t\t\temail: {\n\t\t\t\t\tpersonal: 'alice@home.com',\n\t\t\t\t\twork: 'alice@wonderland.org'\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tjson: {\n\t\t\t\tname: 'Bob',\n\t\t\t\temail: {\n\t\t\t\t\tpersonal: 'bob@mail.com',\n\t\t\t\t\twork: 'contact@thebuilder.com'\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t];\n\n\treturn myContacts;\n\t```\n\n\tWhen you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:\n\n\t<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Result of Code node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n## Referencing node data with the Code node\n\nJust like you can use [expressions](/code/expressions/) to reference data from other nodes, you can also use some [methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) in the **Code node**.\n\nPlease make sure you read these pages before continuing to the next exercise.\n\n### Exercise\n\nLet's build on the previous exercise, in which you used the Code node to create a data set of two contacts with their names and emails. Now, connect a second Code node to the first one. In the new node, write code to create a new column named `workEmail` that references the work email of the first contact.\n\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n\tIn the **Code node**, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:\n\n\t```javascript\n\tlet items = $input.all();\n\titems[0].json.workEmail = items[0].json.email['work'];\n\treturn items;\n\t```\n\n\tWhen you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:\n\n\t<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function_reference.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Code node reference</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n## Transforming data\n\nThe incoming data from some nodes may have a different data structure than the one used in n8n. In this case, you need to [transform the data](/data/transforming-data/){:target=\"_blank\" .external}, so that each item can be processed individually.\n\nThe two most common operations for data transformation are:\n\n- Creating multiple items from one item\n- Creating a single item from multiple items\n\nThere are several ways to transform data for the purposes mentioned above:\n\n- Use n8n's [data transformation nodes](/data/#data-transformation-nodes). Use these nodes to modify the structure of incoming data that contain lists (arrays) without needing to use JavaScript code in the **Code node**:\n\t- Use the [**Split Out node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/) to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.\n\t- Use the [**Aggregate node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.\n- Use the **Code node** to write JavaScript functions to modify the data structure of incoming data using the **Run Once for All Items** mode:\n    - To create multiple items from a single item, you can use JavaScript code like this. This example assumes that the item has a key named `data` set to an array of items in the form of: `[{ \"data\": [{<item_1>}, {<item_2>}, ...] }]`:\n\t```javascript\n\treturn $input.first().json.data.map(item => {\n        return {\n            json: item\n        }\n    });\n\t```\n\t- To create a single item from multiple items, you can use this JavaScript code:\n\t```javascript\n    return [\n    \t{\n        \tjson: {\n        \t\tdata_object: $input.all().map(item => item.json)\n        \t}\n        }\n      ];\n\t```\n\nThese JavaScript examples assume your entire input is what you want to transform. As in the exercise above, you can also execute either operation on a specific field by identifying that in the items list, for example, if our workEmail example had multiple emails in a single field, we could run some code like this:\n```javascript\nlet items = $input.all();\nreturn items[0].json.workEmail.map(item => {\n\treturn {\n\t\tjson: item\n\t}\n});\n```\n\n### Exercise\n\n1. Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the Quotable API `https://api.quotable.io/quotes`. (This API requires no authentication).\n2. Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Split Out node**.\n3. Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Code node**.\n\n\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n\n\t1. To get the quotes from the Quotable API, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:\n\t\t- **Authentication**: None\n\t\t- **Request Method**: GET\n\t\t- **URL**: https://api.quotable.io/quotes\n\t2. To transform the data with the **Split Out node**, connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and set the following parameters:\n\t\t- **Field To Split Out**: results\n\t\t- **Include**: No Other Fields\n\t3. To transform the data with the **Code node**, connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and write the following code in the JavaScript Code field:\n\t\t```javascript\n\t\tlet items = $input.all();\n\t\treturn items[0].json.results.map(item => {\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\tjson: item\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\t\t```",

XML looks similar to HTML, but the tag names are different, as they describe the kind of data they hold.\n///\nIf you need to process HTML or XML data in your n8n workflows, use the [**HTML node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) or the [**XML node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).\n\nUse the **HTML node** to extract HTML content of a webpage by referencing CSS selectors. This is useful if you want to collect structured information from a website (web-scraping).\n\n### HTML Exercise\n\nLet's get the title of the latest n8n blog post:\n\n1. Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the URL `https://blog.n8n.io/` (this endpoint requires no authentication).\n2. Connect an **HTML node** and configure it to extract the title of the first blog post on the page.\n\t- Hint: If you're not familiar with CSS selectors or reading HTML, the CSS selector `.item-title  a` should help!\n\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n\n\t1. Configure the HTTP Request node with the following parameters:\n\t\t- **Authentication**: None\n\t\t- **Request Method**: GET\n\t\t- **URL**: https://blog.n8n.io/\n\tThe result should look like this:\n\n\t<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_httprequestnode.png\" alt=\"Result of HTTP Request node\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Result of HTTP Request node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\t2. Connect an **HTML node** to the **HTTP Request node** and configure the former's parameters:\n\t\t- **Operation**: Extract HTML Content\n\t\t- **Source Data**: JSON\n\t\t- **JSON Property**: data\n\t\t- **Extraction Values**:\n\t\t\t- **Key**: title\n\t\t\t- **CSS Selector**: `.item-title  a`\n\t\t\t- **Return Value**: HTML\n\n\tYou can add more values to extract more data.\n\n\tThe result should look like this:\n\n\t<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_htmlextractnode.png\" alt=\"Result of HTML Extract node\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Result of HTML Extract node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\nUse the **XML node** to convert XML to JSON and JSON to XML. This operation is useful if you work with different web services that use either XML or JSON and need to get and submit data between them in the two formats.\n\n### XML Exercise\n\nIn the [final exercise of Chapter 1](/courses/level-two/chapter-1/#exercise_2), you used an **HTTP Request node** to make a request to the Quotable API. In this exercise, we'll return to that same API but we'll convert the output to XML:\n\n1. Add an **HTTP Request node** that makes the same request to the Quotable API at `https://api.quotable.io/quotes`.\n2. Use the XML node to convert the JSON output to XML.\n\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n\n\t1. To get the quotes from the Quotable API, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:\n\t\t- **Authentication**: None\n\t\t- **Request Method**: GET\n\t\t- **URL**: https://api.quotable.io/quotes\n\t2. Connect an **XML node** to it with the following parameters:\n\t\t- **Mode**: JSON to XML\n\t\t- **Property name**: data\n\n\tThe result should look like this:\n\n\t<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_xmlnode_table.png\" alt=\"Table view of XML Node (JSON to XML)\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>XML node (JSON to XML) \u2013 Table View</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\tTo transform data the other way around, select the mode **XML to JSON**.\n\n\n## Date, time, and interval data\n\nDate and time data types include `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `YEAR`. The dates and times can be passed in different formats, for example:\n<!-- vale off -->\n- `DATE`: March 29 2022, 29-03-2022, 2022/03/29\n- `TIME`: 08:30:00, 8:30, 20:30\n- `DATETIME`: 2022/03/29 08:30:00\n- `TIMESTAMP`: 1616108400 (Unix timestamp), 1616108400000 (Unix ms timestamp)\n- `YEAR`: 2022, 22\n<!-- vale on -->\nThere are a few ways you can work with dates and times:\n\n- Use the [**Date & Time node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) to convert date and time data to different formats and calculate dates.\n- Use [**Schedule Trigger node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) to schedule workflows to run at a specific time, interval, or duration.\n\nSometimes, you might need to pause the workflow execution. This might be necessary if you know that a service doesn't process the data instantly or it's slow to return all the results. In these cases, you don't want n8n to pass incomplete data to the next node.\n\nIf you run into situations like this, use the [**Wait node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) after the node that you want to delay. The **Wait node** pauses the workflow execution and will resume execution:\n\n- At a specific time.\n- After a specified time interval.\n- On a webhook call.\n\n\n\n### Date Exercise\n\nBuild a workflow that adds five days to an input date from the Customer Datastore node that you used before. Then, if the calculated date occurred after 1959, the workflow waits 1 minute before [setting](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) the calculated date as a value. The workflow should be triggered every 30 minutes.\n\n\nTo begin:\n<!-- To do: need to figure out what the actual desired output is here since Date & Time options have changed and I'm unclear what the Set node should be doing-->\n1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected. Return All.\n2. Add the **Date & Time node** to Round Up the created Date from the datastore to End of Month. Output this to field new-date. Include all input fields.\n3. Add the **If node** to check if that new rounded date is after `1960-01-01 00:00:00`.\n4. Add the **Wait node** to the True output of that node and set it to wait for one minute.\n5. Add the **Edit Fields (Set) node** to set a new field called outputValue to a String containing new-date. Include all input fields.\n6. Add the **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow to trigger it every 30 minutes. (You can keep the [Manual Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) for testing!)\n\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n\n\t1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected.\n\t\t- Select the option to **Return All**.\n\t2. Add a **Date & Time node** connected to the Customer Datastore node. Select the option to **Round a Date**.\n\t\t- Add the `created` date as the **Date** to round.\n\t\t- Select `Round Up` as the **Mode** and `End of Month` as the **To**.\n\t\t- Set the **Output Field Name** as `new-date`.\n\t\t- In **Options**, select **Add Option** and use the control to **Include Input Fields**\n\t3. Add an **If node** connected to the **Date & Time node**.\n\t\t- Add the new-date field as the first part of the condition.\n\t\t- Set the comparison to **Date &Time > is after**\n\t\t- Add `1960-01-01 00:00:00` as the second part of the expression. (This should produce 3 items in the True Branch and 2 items in the False Branch)\n\t4. Add a **Wait node** to the True output of the **If node**.\n\t\t- Set **Resume** to `After Time interval`.\n\t\t- Set **Wait Amount** to `1.00`.\n\t\t- Set **Wait Unit** to `Minutes`.\n\t5.

But what if you want to process data that's not text, like images or PDF files? These types of files are represented in the binary numeral system, so they're considered binary data. In this form, binary data doesn't offer you useful information, so you'll need to convert it into a readable form.\n\nIn n8n, you can process binary data with the following nodes:\n\n- [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to request and send files from/to web resources and APIs.\n- [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.\n- [Convert to File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.\n- [Extract From File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.\n\n/// note | Reading and writing files is only available on self-hosted n8n\nReading and writing files to disk isn't available on n8n Cloud. You'll read and write to the machine where you installed n8n. If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host. The Read/Write Files From Disk node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors.\n///\n\nTo read or write a binary file, you need to write the path (location) of the file in the node's `File(s) Selector` parameter (for the Read operation) or in the node's `File Path and Name` parameter (for the Write operation).\n\n/// warning | Naming the right path\nThe file path looks slightly different depending on how you are running n8n:\n\n- npm: `~/my_file.json`\n- n8n cloud / Docker: `/tmp/my_file.json`\n///\n\n\n\n### Binary Exercise 1\n\nFor our first binary exercise, let's convert a PDF file to JSON:\n\n1.

This could include removing duplicate data or updating data in one system when it changes in another.\n\n/// note | One-way vs. two-way sync\nIn a one-way sync, data is synchronized in one direction. One system serves as the single source of truth. When information changes in that main system, it automatically changes in the secondary system; but if information changes in the secondary system, the changes aren't reflected in the main system.\n\nIn a two-way sync, data is synchronized in both directions (between both systems). When information changes in either of the two systems, it automatically changes in the other one as well.\n\n[This blog tutorial](https://n8n.io/blog/how-to-sync-data-between-two-systems/) explains how to sync data one-way and two-way between two CRMs.\n///\n\n\nIn n8n, you can merge data from two different nodes using the [Merge node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/){:target=\"_blank\"}, which provides several merging options:\n\n- [Append](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#append){:target=\"_blank\"}\n- [Combine](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine){:target=\"_blank\"}\n\t- [Merge by Fields](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#merge-by-fields){:target=\"_blank\"}: requires input fields to match on\n\t- [Merge by Position](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#merge-by-position){:target=\"_blank\"}\n\t- [Multiplex](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#multiplex){:target=\"_blank\"}\n- [Choose Branch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#choose-branch){:target=\"_blank\"}\n\nNotice that Combine > Merge by Fields requires you enter input fields to match on. These fields should contain identical values between the data sources so n8n can properly match data together. In the **Merge node**, they're called `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/explanation_mergepropertyinput.png\" alt=\"Property Input fields in the Merge node\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Property Input fields in the Merge node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n/// warning | Property Input in dot notation\nIf you want to reference nested values in the **Merge node** parameters `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`, you need to enter the property key in dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).\n///\n\n/// note\nYou can also find the **Merge node** under the alias Join. This might be more intuitive if you're familiar with SQL joins.\n///\n\n### Merge Exercise\n\nBuild a workflow that merges data from the Customer Datastore node and Code node.\n\n1.

In technical terms, you need to iterate through the data (with loops).\n\nn8n generally handles this repetitive processing automatically, as the nodes run once for each item, so you don't need to build loops into your workflows.\n\nHowever, there are some [exceptions of nodes and operations](/flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions){:target=\"_blank\"} that will require you to build a loop into your workflow.\n\nTo [create a loop in an n8n workflow](/flow-logic/looping/#using-loops-in-n8n){:target=\"_blank\"}, you need to connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node, and add an **If node** to check when to stop the loop.\n\n## Splitting data in batches\n\nIf you need to process large volumes of incoming data, execute the **Code node** multiple times, or avoid API rate limits, it's best to split the data into batches (groups) and process these batches.\n\nFor these processes, use the [**Loop Over Items node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/){:target=\"_blank\"}. This node splits input data into a specified batch size and, with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data.\n\n/// warning | Execution of Loop Over Items node\nThe **Loop Over Items node** stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow, so it's not necessary to add an **If node** to stop the loop.\n///\n\n### Loop/Batch Exercise\n\nBuild a workflow that reads the RSS feed from Medium and dev.to. The workflow should consist of three nodes:\n\n1. A **Code node** that returns the URLs of the RSS feeds of Medium (`https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io`) and dev.to (`https://dev.to/feed/n8n`).\n2. A **Loop Over Items node** with `Batch Size: 1`, that takes in the inputs from the **Code node** and **RSS Read node** and iterates over the items.\n3. An **RSS Read node** that gets the URL of the Medium RSS feed, passed as an expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.\n\t- The **RSS Read node** is one of the [exception nodes](/flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions){:target=\"_blank\"} which processes only the first item it receives, so the **Loop Over Items node** is necessary for iterating over multiple items.\n\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n\n\t1. Add a **Code Node**. You can format the code in several ways, one way is:\n\t\t- Set **Mode** to `Run Once for All Items`.\n\t\t- Set **Language** to `JavaScript`.\n\t\t- Copy the code below and paste it into the JavaScript Code editor:\n\t\t\t```javascript\n\t\t\tlet urls = [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tjson: {\n\t\t\t\t\turl: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io'\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tjson: {\n\t\t\t\t\turl: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n'\n\t\t\t\t\t} \n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t\treturn urls;\n\t\t\t```\n\t2.

Workflow executions may fail for a variety of reasons, ranging from straightforward problems with incorrectly configuring a node or a failure in a third-party service to more mysterious errors.\n\nBut don't panic. In this lesson, you'll learn how you can troubleshoot errors so you can get your workflow up and running as soon as possible.\n\n\n## Checking failed workflows\n\nn8n tracks executions of your workflows.\n\nWhen one of your workflows fails, you can check the Executions log to see what went wrong. The Executions log shows you a list of the latest execution time, status, mode, and running time of your saved workflows.\n\nOpen the Executions log by selecting [**Executions**](/editor-ui/#executions) in the left-side panel. \n\nTo investigate a specific failed execution from the list, select the name or the **View** button that appears when you hover over the row of the respective execution.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/explanation_workflowexecutions.png\" alt=\"Executions log\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Executions log</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\nThis will open the workflow in read-only mode, where you can see the execution of each node. This representation can help you identify at what point the workflow ran into issues.\n\nTo toggle between viewing the execution and the editor, select the **Editor | Executions** button at the top of the page.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/explanation_workflowexecutions_readonly.png\" alt=\"Workflow execution view\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow execution view</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n## Catching erroring workflows\n\nTo catch failed workflows, create a separate [**Error Workflow**](/flow-logic/error-handling/error-workflows/) with the [**Error Trigger node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/). This workflow will only execute if the main workflow execution fails.\n\nUse additional nodes in your **Error Workflow** that make sense, like sending notifications about the failed workflow and its errors using email or Slack.\n\nTo receive error messages for a failed workflow, set the **Error Workflow** in the [Workflow Settings](/workflows/settings/) to an Error Workflow that uses an **Error Trigger node**.\n\nThe only difference between a regular workflow and an Error Workflow is that the latter contains an **Error Trigger node**. Make sure to create this node before you set this as another workflow's designated Error Workflow.\n\n/// note | Error workflows\n- If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.\n- If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.\n- You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.\n- You can set the same Error Workflow for multiple workflows.\n///\n\n### Exercise\n\nIn the previous chapters, you've built several small workflows. Now, pick one of them that you want to monitor and create an Error Workflow for it:\n\n1. Create a new Error Workflow.\n2. Add the **Error Trigger node**.\n3. Connect a node for the communication platform of your choice to the Error Trigger node, like [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/), [Discord](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/), [Telegram](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/), or even [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) or a more generic [Send Email](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/).\n4. In the workflow you want to monitor, open the [Workflow Settings](/workflows/settings/) and select the new Error Workflow you just created. Note that this workflow needs to run automatically to trigger the error workflow.\n\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n\n\tThe workflow for this exercise looks like this:\n\n\t<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/exercise_errors_errortriggernode_workflow.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Error workflow</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\tTo check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:\n\n\t```json\n\t{\n\t\t\"nodes\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"parameters\": {},\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Error Trigger\",\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.errorTrigger\",\n\t\t\t\t\"typeVersion\": 1,\n\t\t\t\t\"position\": [\n\t\t\t\t\t720,\n\t\t\t\t\t-380\n\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"parameters\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"channel\": \"channelname\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"text\": \"=This workflow {{$node[\\\"Error Trigger\\\"].json[\\\"workflow\\\"][\\\"name\\\"]}}failed.\\nHave a look at it here: {{$node[\\\"Error Trigger\\\"].json[\\\"execution\\\"][\\\"url\\\"]}}\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"attachments\": [],\n\t\t\t\t\t\"otherOptions\": {}\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Slack\",\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.slack\",\n\t\t\t\t\"position\": [\n\t\t\t\t\t900,\n\t\t\t\t\t-380\n\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\t\"typeVersion\": 1,\n\t\t\t\t\"credentials\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"slackApi\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"17\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"slack_credentials\"\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t],\n\t\t\"connections\": {\n\t\t\t\"Error Trigger\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"main\": [\n\t\t\t\t\t[\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"node\": \"Slack\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"main\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"index\": 0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t```\n\n\n\n## Throwing exceptions in workflows\n\nAnother way of troubleshooting workflows is to include a [**Stop and Error node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) in your workflow. This node throws an error. You can specify the error type:\n\n- **Error Message**: returns a custom message about the error\n- **Error Object**: returns the type of error\n\nYou can only use the **Stop and Error node** as the last node in a workflow.\n\n/// note | When to throw errors\nThrowing exceptions with the **Stop and Error node** is useful for verifying the data (or assumptions about the data) from a node and returning custom error messages.\n\nIf you are working with data from a third-party service, you may come across problems such as:\n\n- Wrongly formatted JSON output\n- Data with the wrong type (for example, numeric data that has a non-numeric value)\n- Missing values\n- Errors from remote servers\n\nThough this kind of invalid data might not cause the workflow to fail right away, it could cause problems later on, and then it can become difficult to track the source error. This is why it's better to throw an error at the time you know there might be a problem.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/exercise_errors_stopanderror.png\" alt=\"Stop and Error node with error message\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Stop and Error node with error message</i></figcaption></figure>\n///",

This data contains information about the customers' ID, country, email, and join date, but lacks data about their respective region and subregion. You need to fill in these last two fields in order to create the reports for regional sales.\n\nTo accomplish this task, you first need to make a copy of this table in your Airtable account:\n\n<iframe class=\"airtable-embed\" src=\"https://airtable.com/embed/shrNX9tjPkVLABbNz?backgroundColor=orange&viewControls=on\" frameborder=\"0\" onmousewheel=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"533\" style=\"background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;\"></iframe>\n\nNext, build a small workflow that merges data from Airtable and a REST Countries API:\n\n1. Use the [**Airtable node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) to list the data in the Airtable table named `customers`.\n2. Use the [**HTTP Request node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get data from the REST Countries API: `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`. This will return data about world countries, split out into separate items.\n3. Use the [**Merge node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) to merge data from Airtable and the Countries API by country name, represented as `customerCountry` in Airtable and `name.common` in the Countries API, respectively.\n4. Use another Airtable node to update the fields `region` and `subregion` in Airtable with the data from the Countries API.\n\nThe workflow should look like this:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow1.png\" alt=\"Workflow 1 for merging data from Airtable and the Countries API\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow 1 for merging data from Airtable and the Countries API</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n/// question | Quiz questions\n* How many items does the **HTTP Request node** return?\n* How many items does the **Merge node** return?\n* How many unique regions are assigned in the customers table?\n* What's the subregion assigned to the customerID 10?\n///",

The final workflow should look like this:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2.png\" alt=\"Workflow 2 for aggregating data and generating files\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow 2 for aggregating data and generating files</i></figcaption></figure>\n\nTo make things easier, let's split the workflow into three parts.\n\n## Part 1: Getting data from different sources\n\nThe first part of the workflow consists of five nodes:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2_1.png\" alt=\"Workflow 1: Getting data from different sources\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow 1: Getting data from different sources</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n1. Use the [**HTTP Request node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get data from the API endpoint that stores company data. Configure the following node parameters:\n\n    - **Method**: Get\n    - **URL**: The **Dataset URL** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n    - **Authentication**: Generic Credential Type\n        - **Generic Auth Type**: Header Auth\n        - **Credentials for Header Auth**: The Header Auth name and Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n    - **Send Headers**: Toggle to true\n        - **Specify Headers**: Select `Using Fields Below`\n        - **Name**: `unique_id`\n        - **Value**: The unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n\n2. Use the [**Airtable node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) to list data from the `customers` table (where you updated the fields `region` and `subregion`).\n3. Use the [**Merge node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) to merge data from the Airtable and HTTP Request node, based on matching the input fields for `customerID`.\n4. Use the [**Sort node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/) to sort data by `orderPrice` in descending order.\n\n/// question | Quiz questions\n* What's the name of the employee assigned to customer 1?\n* What's the order status of customer 2?\n* What's the highest order price?\n///\n\n## Part 2: Generating file for regional sales\n\nThe second part of the workflow consists of four nodes:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2_2.png\" alt=\"Workflow 2: Generating file for regional sales\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow 2: Generating file for regional sales</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n1. Use the [**If node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) to filter to only display orders from the region `Americas`.\n2. Use the [**Convert to File**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to transform the incoming data from JSON to binary format. Convert each item to a separate file. (Bonus points if you can figure out how to name each report based on the orderID!)\n3. Use the [**Gmail node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) (or another email node) to send the files using email to an address you have access to. Note that you need to add an attachment with the data property.\n4. Use the [**Discord node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) to send a message in the n8n Discord channel `#course-level-two`. In the node, configure the following parameters:\n    * **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n    * **Text**: \"I sent the file using email with the label ID `{label ID}`. My ID: \" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course. <br/> Note that you need to replace the text in curly braces `{}` with expressions that reference the data from the nodes.\n\n/// question | Quiz questions\n* How many orders are assigned to the `Americas` region?\n* What's the total price of the orders in the `Americas` region?\n* How many items does the **Write Binary File node** return?\n///\n\n## Part 3: Generating files for total sales\n\nThe third part of the workflow consists of five nodes:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2_3.png\" alt=\"Workflow 3: Generating files for total sales\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow 3: Generating files for total sales</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n1. Use the [**Loop Over Items node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) to split data from the Item Lists node into batches of 5.\n2. Use the [**Set node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) to set four values, referenced with expressions from the previous node: `customerEmail`, `customerRegion`, `customerSince`, and `orderPrice`.\n3. Use the [**Date & Time node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) to change the date format of the field `customerSince` to the format MM/DD/YYYY.\n    - Set the **Include Input Fields** option to keep all the data together.\n4. Use the [**Convert to File node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to create a CSV spreadsheet with the file name set as the expression: `{{$runIndex > 0 ? 'file_low_orders':'file_high_orders'}}`.\n5. Use the [**Discord node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) to send a message in the n8n Discord channel `#course-level-two`. In the node, configure the following parameters:\n    * **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n    * **Text**: \"I created the spreadsheet `{file name}`. My ID:\" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course. <br/> Note that you need to replace `{file name}` with an expression that references data from the previous **Convert to File node**.<br/>\n\n/// question | Quiz questions\n* What's the lowest order price in the first batch of items?\n* What's the formatted date of customer 7?\n* How many items does the **Convert to File node** return?\n///\n\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n\n\tTo check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor

Create a new workflow.\n2. Add an **Error Trigger node** (and execute it as a test).\n3. Connect a **Discord node** to the **Error Trigger node** and configure these fields:<br/>\n\n\t* **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL that you received in the email from n8n when you signed up for this course.\n\t* **Text**: \"The workflow `{workflow name}` failed, with the error message: `{execution error message}`. Last node executed: `{name of the last executed node}`. Check this workflow execution here: `{execution URL}` My Unique ID: \" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.\n\n\t\tNote that you need to replace the text in curly brackets `{}` with expressions that take the respective information from the Error Trigger node.<br/>\n\n4. Execute the Discord node.\n5. Set the newly created workflow as the **Error Workflow** for the main workflow you created in the previous lesson.\n\nThe workflow should look like this:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow3.png\" alt=\"Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n/// question | Quiz questions\n* What fields does the **Error Trigger node** return?\n* What information about the execution does the **Error Trigger node** return?\n* What information about the workflow does the **Error Trigger node** return?\n* What's the expression to reference the workflow name?\n///",

Setting Values for Processing Orders\n\nIn this step of the workflow, you will learn how to select and set data before transferring it to Airtable using the Edit Fields (Set) node.\n\nThe next step in Nathan's workflow is to insert the `employeeName` and `orderID` of all `processing` orders into Airtable.\n\nFor this, you need to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/), which allows you to select and set the data you want to transfer from one app/service to another.\n\n/// note | Edit Fields node\nThe Edit Fields node can set completely new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values into spreadsheets or databases.\n///\n\n## Disconnect the Airtable node\n\nIn your workflow, disconnect the Airtable node** from the **If node in the same way we disconnected it in the [Filtering Orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/) lesson.\n\n## Configure the Edit Fields node\n\nNow add a new Edit Fields (Set) node** attached to the **If node's `true` connector by selecting the **+** icon with that connector and searching for **Edit Fields**.\n\nWith the Edit Fields node window open, configure these parameters:\n\n- Ensure **Mode** is set to **Manual Mapping**.\n- While you can use the **Expression editor** we used in the [Filtering Orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/) lesson, this time, let's drag the fields from the **Input** into the **Fields to Set**:\n    - Drag **orderID** as the first field.\n    - Drag **employeeName** as the second field.\n- Ensure that **Include Other Input Fields** is set to false.\n\nSelect **Test step**. You should see the following results:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-4-set-node.png\" alt=\"Edit Fields (Set) node\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Edit Fields (Set) node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n## Add data to Airtable\n\nNext, let's insert these values into Airtable:\n\n1. Go to your Airtable account.\n2. Add a new table called `processingOrders`. You can add this table to your existing workspace/table if you choose.\n3. Add two columns to this table:\n    - `orderID`: Number\n    - `employeeName`: Single line text\n    \n    ///note | Reminder\n    If you get stuck, refer back to the [Inserting data into Airtable](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.2/) lesson.\n    ///\n  \n4. Be sure to delete the three empty rows in the new table!\n5. With the new table created, update the Airtable node configuration to point to this new `processingOrders` table instead of the `orders` table.\n6. Connect the Edit Fields node** connector to the **Airtable node.\n7. Test your Airtable node to be sure it inserts records into the new `processingOrders` table.\n\nAt this stage, your workflow should now look like this:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-4-workflow-with-set-node.png\" alt=\"Workflow with the Edit Fields node\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow with the Edit Fields node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n## What's next?\n\n**Nathan \ud83d\ude4b**: You've already automated half of my work! Now I still need to calculate the booked orders for my colleagues. Can that be automated as well?\n\n**You \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd27**: Yes! In the next step, I'll use some JavaScript code in a node to calculate the booked orders.",

Calculating Booked Orders\n\nIn this step of the workflow you will learn how n8n data is structured and how to add custom JavaScript code to perform calculations using the Code node.\n\nThe next step in Nathan's workflow is to calculate two values from the booked orders:\n\n- The total number of booked orders\n- The total value of all booked orders\n\nTo calculate data and add more functionality to your workflows you can use the Code node, which lets you write custom JavaScript code.\n\n## About the Code node\n\n/// warning | Code node modes\nThe Code node has two operational **Modes** that change the way it processes data. The **Run Once for All Items** mode allows you to accumulate data from all items on the input list. The **Run Once for Each Item** is used to add custom snippets of JavaScript code that should be executed once for every item that it receives as the input. Learn more about how to use the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).\n///\n- Create your own node.\n- Write custom expressions.\n- Use the Code node.\n- Get the most out of n8n.\n\nIn n8n, the data that's passed between nodes is an array of objects with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n   \t // Each item has to contain a \"json\" property. But it can be an empty object like {}.\n   \t // Any kind of JSON data is allowed. So arrays and the data being deeply nested is fine.\n   \t json: { // The actual data n8n operates on (required)\n   \t\t // This data is only an example, it could be any kind of JSON data\n   \t\t apple: 'beets',\n   \t\t carrot: {\n   \t\t\t dill: 1\n   \t\t }\n   \t },\n   \t // Binary data of item. Most items in n8n do not contain any (optional)\n   \t binary: {\n   \t\t // The key-name \"apple\" is only an example. Any kind of key-name is possible.\n   \t\t apple-picture: {\n   \t\t\t data: '....', // Base64 encoded binary data (required)\n   \t\t\t mimeType: 'image/png', // Optional but should be set if possible (optional)\n   \t\t\t fileExtension: 'png', // Optional but should be set if possible (optional)\n   \t\t\t fileName: 'example.png', // Optional but should be set if possible (optional)\n   \t\t }\n   \t }\n    },\n    ...\n]\n```\n## Configure the Code node\n\nNow let's see how to implement this.\n\nIn your workflow, add a Code node** connected to the `false` branch of the **If node. \n\nWith the Code node window open, configure these parameters:\n\n- **Mode**: Select **Run Once for All Items**\n- **Language**: Select **JavaScript**\n- Copy the Code below and paste it into the **Code** box:\n```javascript\nlet items = $input.all();\nlet totalBooked = items.length;\nlet bookedSum = 0;\n\nfor(let i=0; i < items.length; i++) {\n  bookedSum = bookedSum + items[i].json.orderPrice;\n}\nreturn [{json:{totalBooked, bookedSum}}];\n```\n\nNotice the format in which we return the results of the calculation:<br>\n`return [{json:{totalBooked, bookedSum}}]`\n\n/// warning | Data structure error\nIf you don't use the correct data structure, you will get an error message: `Error: Always an Array of items has to be returned!`\n///\n\nNow select **Test step** and you should see the following results:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-5-code-node.png\" alt=\"Code node output\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Code node output</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n/// note | Using Python in code nodes\nYou can also use Python in the Code node. To learn more about this, refer to the [Code node](/code/code-node/) documentation.\n///\n\n## What's next?\n\n**Nathan \ud83d\ude4b**: Wow, the Code node is really powerful! This means that if I have some basic JavaScript skills I can power up my workflows.\n\n**You \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd27**: Yes! You can progress from no-code to low-code!\n\n**Nathan \ud83d\ude4b**: Now, how do I send the calculations for the booked orders to my team's Discord channel?\n\n**You \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd27**: There's an n8n node for that. I'll set it up in the next step.",

Notifying the Team\n\nIn this step of the workflow, you will learn how to send messages to a Discord channel using the [Discord node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/).\n\nNow that you have a calculated summary of the booked orders, you need to notify Nathan's team in their Discord channel. For this workflow, you will send messages to the [n8n server](https://discord.gg/G98WXzsjky){:target=\"_blank\" .external} on Discord.\n\nBefore you begin the steps below, use the link above to connect to the n8n server on Discord. Be sure you can access the `#course-level-1` channel.\n\n/// note | Communication nodes\nYou can replace the Discord node with another communication app. For example, n8n also has nodes for [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/){:target=\"_blank\" .external} and [Mattermost](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/){:target=\"_blank\" .external}.\n///\n\nIn your workflow, add a Discord node connected to the Code node.\n\nWhen you search for the Discord node, look for **Message Actions** and select **Send a message** to add the node.\n\nIn the Discord node window, configure these parameters:\n\n- **Connection Type**: Select **Webhook**.\n- **Credential for Discord Webhook**: Select **- Create New Credential -**.\n    - Copy the **Webhook URL** from the email you received when you signed up for this course and paste it into the **Webhook URL** field of the credentials.\n    - Select **Save** and then close the credentials dialog.\n- **Operation**: Select **Send a Message**.\n- **Message**:\n    - Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the Message field.\n    - Copy the text below and paste it into the **Expression** window, or construct it manually using the **Expression Editor**.\n        - `This week we've {{$json[\"totalBooked\"]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json[\"bookedSum\"]}}. My Unique ID: {{ $('HTTP Request').params[\"headerParameters\"][\"parameters\"][0][\"value\"] }}`\n\n        /// note | Constructing your own message\n        To add the Unique ID portion of the statement, you'll need to expand **Nodes** > **HTTP Request** > **Parameters** > **headerParameters** > **parameters** > **[Item: 0]** and select the **value**.\n        ///\n\nNow select **Test step** in the Discord node.

I just need to remember to run it every Monday morning at 9 AM...\n\n**You \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd27**: Don't worry about that, you can actually schedule the workflow to run on a specific day, time, or interval. I'll set this up in the next step.",

Scheduling the Workflow\n\nIn this step of the workflow, you will learn how to schedule your workflow so that it runs automatically at a set time/interval using the Schedule Trigger node.\n\nThe workflow you've built so far executes only when you click on **Test Workflow**. But Nathan needs it to run automatically every Monday morning. You can do this with the [Schedule Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), which allows you to schedule workflows to run periodically at fixed dates, times, or intervals.\n\nTo achieve this, we'll remove the Manual Trigger node we started with and replace it with a Schedule Trigger node instead.\n\n## Remove the Manual Trigger node\n\nFirst, let's remove the Manual Trigger node:\n\n1. Select the Manual Trigger node connected to your HTTP Request node.\n2. Select the trash can icon to delete.\n\nThe Manual Trigger node will be removed and you'll see an \"Add first step\" option.\n\n## Add the Schedule Trigger node\n\n1. Open the nodes panel and search for **Schedule Trigger**.\n2. Select it when it appears in the search results.\n\nIn the Schedule Trigger node window, configure these parameters:\n\n- **Trigger Interval**: Select **Weeks**.\n- **Weeks Between Triggers**: Enter `1`.\n- **Trigger on weekdays**: Select **Monday** (and remove **Sunday** if it was automatically added).\n- **Trigger at Hour**: Select **9am**.\n- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter\u00a0`0`.\n\nYour Schedule Trigger node should look like this:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-7-schedule-trigger-node.png\" alt=\"Schedule Trigger Node\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Schedule Trigger Node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n/// warning | Keep in mind\nTo ensure accurate scheduling with the Schedule Trigger node, be sure the timezone is set correctly for your [n8n instance](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) or the [workflow's settings](/workflows/settings/). The Schedule Trigger node will use the workflow's timezone if it's set; it will fall back to the n8n instance's timezone if it's not.\n///\n\n## Connect the Schedule Trigger node\n\nReturn to the canvas and connect your Schedule Trigger node to the HTTP Request node by dragging the arrow from it to the HTTP Request node.\n\nYour full workflow should look like this:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-7-inactivated-workflow.png\" alt=\"Full workflow\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Full workflow</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n## What's next?\n\n**You \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd27**: That was it for the workflow! I've added and configured all necessary nodes. Now every time you click on **Test workflow**, all nodes will be executed: getting, filtering, calculating, and transferring the sales data.\n\n**Nathan \ud83d\ude4b**: This is just what I needed! My workflow will run automatically every Monday morning, correct?\n\n**You \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd27**: Not so fast. To do that, you need to activate your workflow.

Activating and Examining the Workflow\n\nIn this step of the workflow, you will learn how to activate your workflow and change the default workflow settings.\n\nActivating a workflow means that it will run automatically every time a trigger node receives input or meets a condition. By default, all newly created workflows are deactivated.\n\nTo activate your workflow, set the **Inactive** toggle in the top navigation of the Editor UI to be **Activated**. Nathan's workflow will now be executed automatically every Monday at 9 AM:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-activated-workflow.png\" alt=\"Activated workflow\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Activated workflow</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n## Workflow Executions\n\nAn execution represents a completed run of a workflow, from the first to the last node. n8n logs workflow executions, allowing you to see if the workflow was completed successfully or not. The execution log is useful for debugging your workflow and seeing at what stage it runs into issues.\n\nTo see the execution log, in your Editor UI select **All executions** in the left panel. This will open the **Executions** window.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-execution-list.png\" alt=\"Execution List\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Execution List</i></figcaption></figure>\n\nThe **Executions** window displays a table with the following information:\n\n- **Name**: The name of the workflow\n- **Started At**: The date and time when the workflow started\n- **Status**: The status of the workflow (Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Cancelled, or Failed) and the amount of time it took the workflow to execute\n- **Execution ID**: The ID of this workflow execution\n\n/// note | Workflow execution status\nYou can filter the displayed **Executions** by workflow and by status (**Any Status**, **Failed**, **Cancelled**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**).\nThe information displayed here depends on which executions are configured to be saved in the [**Workflow Settings**](/workflows/settings/).\n///\n\n\n## Workflow Settings\n\nYou can customize your workflows and executions, or overwrite some of the global default settings in\u00a0[**Workflow Settings**](/workflows/settings/).\n\nAccess these settings by selecting the three dots in the upper right corner of the Editor UI, then select **Settings**.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-workflow-settings.png\" alt=\"Workflow Settings\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow Settings</i></figcaption></figure>\n\nIn the **Workflow Settings** window you can configure the following settings:\n\n- [**Error Workflow**](/flow-logic/error-handling/):\u00a0A workflow to run in case the execution of the current workflow fails.\n- **This workflow can be called by**: Workflows that are allowed to call this workflow using the [Execute Workflow node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/).\n- **Timezone**:\u00a0The timezone to use in the current workflow. If not set, the global timezone (by default \"New York\") is used. This setting is particularly important for the [Schedule Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), as you want to make sure that the workflow gets executed at the right time.\n- **Save failed production executions**: If the Execution data of the workflow should be saved when it fails. Default is to save.\n- **Save successful production executions**: If the Execution data of the workflow should be saved when it succeeds. Default is to save.\n- **Save manual executions**: If executions started from the Editor UI should be saved. Default is to save.\n- **Save execution progress**: If the execution data of each node should be saved. If set to Save, you can resume the workflow from where it stopped in case of an error, though keep in mind that this might make the execution slower. Default is not to save.\n- **Timeout Workflow**: Whether to cancel a workflow execution after a specific period of time. Default is not to timeout.\n\n\n## What's next?\n\n**You \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd27**: That was it! Now you have a 7-node workflow that will run automatically every Monday morning. You don't have to worry about remembering to wrangle the data. Instead, you can start your week with more meaningful or exciting work.\n\n**Nathan \ud83d\ude4b**: This workflow is incredibly helpful, thank you! Now, what's next for you?\n\n**You \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd27**: I'd like to build more workflows, share them with others, and use some workflows built by other people.",

Let's do it!\n\n\n## Workflow design\n\nNow that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's list the steps he needs to take to achieve this:\n\n1. Get and combine data from all necessary sources.\n2. Sort the data and format the dates.\n3. Write binary files.\n4. Send notifications using email and Discord.\n\nn8n provides [core nodes](/integrations/builtin/node-types/#core-nodes) for all these steps. This use case is somewhat complex. We should build it from three separate workflows:\n\n1. A workflow that merges the company data with external information.\n2. A workflow that generates the reports.\n3. A workflow that monitors errors in the second workflow.\n\n## Workflow prerequisites\n\nTo build the workflows, you will need the following:\n\n* An [Airtable](https://airtable.com/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} account and [credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/).\n* A [Google](https://www.google.com/account/about/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} account and [credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) to access Gmail.\n* A [Discord](https://discord.com/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} account and webhook URL (you receive this using email when you sign up for this course).\n\nNext, you will build these three workflows with step-by-step instructions.",

It doesn't include changing (transforming) data, just referencing it.\n\nYou can map data in the following ways:\n\n* Using the expressions editor.\n* By dragging and dropping data from the **INPUT** into parameters. This generates the expression for you.\n\nFor information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).\n\n## How to drag and drop data\n\n1. Run your workflow to load data.\n2. Open the node where you need to map data.\n3. You can map in table, JSON, and schema view:\n\t* In table view: click and hold a table heading to map top level data, or a field in the table to map nested data.\n\t* In JSON view: click and hold a key. \n\t* In schema view: click and hold a key.\n4. Drag the item into the field where you want to use the data.\n\n### Understand what you're mapping with drag and drop\n\nData mapping maps the key path, and loads the key's value into the field. For example, given the following data:\n\n```js\n[\n\t{\n\t\t\"fruit\": \"apples\",\n\t\t\"color\": \"green\"\n\t}\n]\n```\n\nYou can map `fruit` by dragging and dropping **fruit** from the **INPUT** into the field where you want to use its value. This creates an expression, `{{ $json.fruit }}`. When the node iterates over input items, the value of the field becomes the value of `fruit` for each item.\n\n### Understand nested data\n\nGiven the following data:\n\n```js\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"First item\",\n    \"nested\": {\n      \"example-number-field\": 1,\n      \"example-string-field\": \"apples\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Second item\",\n    \"nested\": {\n      \"example-number-field\": 2,\n      \"example-string-field\": \"oranges\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nn8n displays it in table form like this:\n\n![\"Screenshot of a table in the INPUT panel. It includes a top level field named \"nested.\" This field contains nested data, which is indicated in bold.\"](/_images/data/data-mapping/nested-data.png)",
    "item-linking-code-node.md": "Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. It also has implications when using the Code node. Most nodes link every output item to an input item. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. For a deeper conceptual overview of this topic, refer to [Item linking concepts](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts). This document focuses on practical usage examples.\n\nWhen using the Code node, there are some scenarios where you need to manually supply item linking information if you want to be able to use `$(\"<node-name>\").item` later in the workflow. All these scenarios only apply if you have more than one incoming item. n8n automatically handles item linking for single items.\n\nThese scenarios are when you:\n\n* Add new items: the new items aren't linked to any input.\n* Return new items.\n* Want to manually control the item linking.\n\n[n8n's automatic item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) handles the other scenarios.\n\nTo control item linking, set `pairedItem` when returning data. For example, to link to the item at index 0:\n\n```js\n[\n\t{\n\t\t\"json\": {\n\t\t\t. . . \n\t\t},\n\t\t// The index of the input item that generated this output item\n\t\t\"pairedItem\": 0\n\t}\n]\n```\n\n\n### `pairedItem` usage example\n\nTake this input data:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"23423532\",\n    \"name\": \"Jay Gatsby\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"23423533\",\n    \"name\": \"Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"23423534\",\n    \"name\": \"Max Sendak\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"23423535\",\n    \"name\": \"Zaphod Beeblebrox\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"23423536\",\n    \"name\": \"Edmund Pevensie\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAnd use it to generate new items, containing just the name, along with a new piece of data:\n\n```js\nnewItems = [];\nfor(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){\n  newItems.push(\n    {\n    \"json\":\n      {\n        \"name\": items[i].json.name,\n\t\t\t\t\"aBrandNewField\": \"New data for item \" + i\n      }\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nreturn newItems;\n```\n\n`newItems` is an array of items with no `pairedItem`. This means there's no way to trace back from these items to the items used to generate them.\n\nAdd the `pairedItem` object:\n\n```js\nnewItems = [];\nfor(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){\n  newItems.push(\n    {\n      \"json\":\n        {\n          \"name\": items[i].json.name,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"aBrandNewField\": \"New data for item \" + i\n        },\n      \"pairedItem\": i\n    }    \n  )\n}\nreturn newItems;\n```\n\nEach new item now links to the item used to create it.",

This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. This can be complicated to understand, especially if the node splits or merges data. You need to understand item linking when building your own programmatic nodes, or in some scenarios using the Code node. \n\nThis document provides a conceptual overview of this feature. For usage details, refer to:\n\n* [Item linking for node creators](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/), for details on how to handle item linking when building a node.\n* [Item linking in the Code node](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/), to learn how to handle item linking in the Code node.\n* [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/), to understand the errors you may encounter in the editor UI.\n\n## n8n's automatic item linking\n\nIf a node doesn't control how to link input items to output items, n8n tries to guess how to link the items automatically:\n\n* Single input, single output: the output links to the input.\n* Single input, multiple outputs: all outputs link to that input.\n* Multiple inputs and outputs:\n\t* If you keep the input items, but change the order (or remove some but keep others), n8n can automatically add the correct linked item information.\n\t* If the number of inputs and outputs is equal, n8n links the items in order. This means that output-1 links to input-1, output-2 to input-2, and so on.\n\t* If the number isn't equal, or you create completely new items, n8n can't automatically link items.\n\nIf n8n can't link items automatically, and the node doesn't handle the item linking, n8n displays an error. Refer to [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/) for more information.\n\n## Item linking example\n\n![A diagram showing the threads linking multiple items back through a workflow](/_images/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-multiple-lines.png)\n\nIn this example, it's possible for n8n to link an item in one node back several steps, despite the item order changing. This means the node that sorts movies alphabetically can access information about the linked item in the node that gets famous movie actors.\n\nThe methods for accessing linked items are different depending on whether you're using the UI, expressions, or the code node. Explore the following resources:\n\n* [Mapping in the UI](/data/data-mapping/data-mapping-ui/)\n* [Mapping in the expressions editor](/data/data-mapping/data-mapping-expressions/)\n* [Item linking in the Code node](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/)\n* [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/)",

This doesn't have to be the node just before: it can be any previous node in the chain. When referencing nodes further back, you use the expression syntax `$(node_name).item`. \n\n<figure markdown>\n![A diagram showing the threads linking multiple items back through a workflow](/_images/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-multiple-lines.png)\n<figcaption markdown>Diagram of threads for different items. Due to the item linking, you can get the actor for each movie using `$('Get famous movie actors').item`.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSince the previous node can have multiple items in it, n8n needs to know which one to use. When using `.item`, n8n figures this out for you behind the scenes. Refer to [Item linking concepts](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) for detailed information on how this works.\n\n`.item` fails if information is missing. To figure out which item to use, n8n maintains a thread back through the workflow's nodes for each item. For a given item, this thread tells n8n which items in previous nodes generated it. To find the matching item in a given previous node, n8n follows this thread back until it reaches the node in question.\n\nWhen using `.item`, n8n displays an error when:\n\n- The thread is broken\n- The thread points to more than one item in the previous node (as it's unclear which one to use)\n\nTo solve these errors, you can either avoid using `.item`, or fix the root cause.\n\nYou can avoid `.item` by using `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. They require you to know the position of the item that you\u2019re targeting within the target node's output items. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](/code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.\n\nThe fix for the root cause depends on the exact error.\n\n### Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'\n\nIf you see this error message:\n\n> ERROR: Info for expression missing from previous node\n\nThere's a node in the chain that doesn't return pairing information. The solution here depends on the type of the previous node:\n\n- Code nodes: make sure you return which input items the node used to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking in the code node](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/) for more information.\n- Custom or community nodes: the node creator needs to update the node to return which input items it uses to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking for node creators](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/) for more information.\n\n### Fix for 'Multiple matching items for expression'\n\nThis is the error message:\n\n> ERROR: Multiple matching items for expression\n\nSometimes n8n uses multiple items to create a single item. Examples include the Summarize, Aggregate, and Merge nodes. These nodes can combine information from multiple items.\n\nWhen you use `.item` and there are multiple possible matches, n8n doesn't know which one to use. To solve this you can either:\n\n- Use `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](/code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.\n- Reference a different node that contains the same information, but doesn't have multiple matching items.",

This credential data isn't visible to users but the backend uses it automatically.\n\nIn the Editor UI, n8n hides all overwritten fields by default. This means that users are able to authenticate using  OAuth by pressing the \"connect\" button on the credentials.\n\nn8n offers two ways to apply credential overwrites: using Environment Variable and using the REST API.\n\n#### Using environment variables\n\nYou can set credential overwrites using environment variable by setting the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA` to `{ CREDENTIAL_NAME: { PARAMETER: VALUE }}`.\n\n/// warning\nEven though this is possible, it isn't recommended. Environment variables aren't protected in n8n, so the data can leak to users.\n///\n\n#### Using REST APIs\n\nThe recommended way is to load the data using a custom REST endpoint. Set the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT` to a path under which this endpoint should be made available.\n\n/// note\nThe endpoints can be called just one at a time for security reasons.\n///\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Activate the endpoint by setting the environment variable in the environment n8n runs under:\n\n    ```sh\n    export CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT=send-credentials\n    ```\n\n2. A JSON file with the credentials to overwrite is then needed. For example, a `oauth-credentials.json` file to overwrite credentials for Asana and GitHub could look like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"asanaOAuth2Api\": {\n            \"clientId\": \"<id>\",\n            \"clientSecret\": \"<secret>\"\n        },\n        \"githubOAuth2Api\": {\n            \"clientId\": \"<id>\",\n            \"clientSecret\": \"<secret>\"\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. Then apply it to the instance by sending it using curl:\n\n    ```sh\n    curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data @oauth-credentials.json http://localhost:5678/send-credentials\n    ```\n\n/// note\nThere are cases when credentials are based on others. For example, the `googleSheetsOAuth2Api` extends the `googleOAuth2Api`.\nIn this case, you can set parameters on the parent credentials (`googleOAuth2Api`) for all child-credentials (`googleSheetsOAuth2Api`) to use.\n///\n\n## Environment variables\n\nn8n has many [environment variables](/reference/environment-variables/) you can configure. Here are the most relevant environment variables for your hosted solution:\n\n| Variable | Type | Default | Description |\n| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |\n| `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` | Number | `-1` | Sets a default timeout (in seconds) to all workflows after which n8n stops their execution. Users can override this for individual workflows up to the duration set in `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX`. Set `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` to `-1` to disable. |\n| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` | Boolean | `true` | Whether to delete data of past executions on a rolling basis. |\n| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` | Number | `336` | The execution age (in hours) before it's deleted. |\n| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` | Number | `10000` | Maximum number of executions to keep in the database. 0 = no limit |\n| `NODES_EXCLUDE` | Array of strings | - | Specify which nodes not to load. For example, to block nodes that can be a security risk if users aren't trustworthy: `NODES_EXCLUDE: \"[\\\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\\\", \\\"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\\\"]\"` |\n| `NODES_INCLUDE` | Array of strings | - | Specify which nodes to load. |\n| `N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` | Boolean | `true` | Enable workflow templates (true) or disable (false). |\n| `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST` | String | `https://api.n8n.io` | Change this if creating your own workflow template library. Note that to use your own workflow templates library, your API must provide the same endpoints and response structure as n8n's. Refer to [Workflow templates](/workflows/templates/) for more information. |\n\n## Backend hooks\n\nIt's possible to define external hooks that n8n executes whenever a specific operation runs. You can use these, for example, to log data, change data, or forbid an action by throwing an error.\n\n### Available hooks\n\n| Hook     | Arguments | Description |\n| :------- | :---------| :---------- |\n| `credentials.create` | `[credentialData: ICredentialsDb]` | Called before new credentials get created. Use to restrict the number of credentials. |\n| `credentials.delete` | `[id: credentialId]` | Called before credentials get deleted. |\n| `credentials.update` | `[credentialData: ICredentialsDb]` | Called before existing credentials are saved. |\n| `frontend.settings` | `[frontendSettings: IN8nUISettings]` | Gets called on n8n startup. Allows you to, for example, overwrite frontend data like the displayed OAuth URL. |\n| `n8n.ready` | `[app: App]` | Called once n8n is ready. Use to, for example, register custom API endpoints. |\n| `n8n.stop` |  | Called when an n8n process gets stopped. Allows you to save some process data. |\n| `oauth1.authenticate` | `[oAuthOptions: clientOAuth1.Options, oauthRequestData: {oauth_callback: string}]` | Called before an OAuth1 authentication. Use to overwrite an OAuth callback URL. |\n| `oauth2.callback` | `[oAuth2Parameters: {clientId: string, clientSecret: string \\| undefined, accessTokenUri: string, authorizationUri: string, redirectUri: string, scopes: string[]}]` | Called in an OAuth2 callback. Use to overwrite an OAuth callback URL. |\n| `workflow.activate` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowDb]` | Called before a workflow gets activated. Use to restrict the number of active workflows. |\n| `workflow.afterDelete` | `[workflowId: string]` | Called after a workflow gets deleted. |\n| `workflow.afterUpdate` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called after an existing workflow gets saved. |\n| `workflow.create` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called before a workflow gets created. Use to restrict the number of saved workflows. |\n| `workflow.delete` | `[workflowId: string]` | Called before a workflow gets delete. |\n| `workflow.postExecute` | `[run: IRun, workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called after a workflow gets executed. |\n| `workflow.preExecute` | `[workflow: Workflow: mode: WorkflowExecuteMode]` | Called before a workflow gets executed. Allows you to count or limit the number of workflow executions. |\n| `workflow.update` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called before an existing workflow gets saved. |\n\n### Registering hooks\n\nSet hooks by registering a hook file that contains the hook functions.\nTo register a hook, set the environment variable `EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES`.\n\nYou can set the variable to a single file:\n\n`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook.js`\n\nOr to contain multiple files separated by a semicolon:\n\n`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook1.js;/data/hook2.js`\n\n### Backend hook files\n\nHook files are regular JavaScript files that have the following format:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n    \"frontend\": {\n        \"settings\": [\n            async function (settings) {\n                settings.oauthCallbackUrls.oauth1 = 'https://n8n.example.com/oauth1/callback';\n                settings.oauthCallbackUrls.oauth2 = 'https://n8n.example.com/oauth2/callback';\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"workflow\": {\n        \"activate\": [\n            async function (workflowData) {\n                const activeWorkflows = await this.dbCollections.Workflow.count({ active: true });\n\n                if (activeWorkflows > 1) {\n                    throw new Error(\n                        'Active workflow limit reached.'\n                    );\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Backend hook functions\n\nA hook or a hook file can contain multiple hook functions, with all functions executed one after another.\n\nIf the parameters of the hook function are objects, it's possible to change the data of that parameter to change the behavior of n8n.\n\nYou can also access the database in any hook function using `this.dbCollections` (refer to the code sample in [Backend hook files](#backend-hook-files).\n\n## Frontend external hooks\n\nLike backend external hooks, it's possible to define external hooks in the frontend code that get executed by n8n whenever a user performs a specific operation. You can use them, for example, to log data and change data.\n\n### Available hooks\n\n| Hook     | Description |\n| :------- | :---------- |\n| `credentialsEdit.credentialTypeChanged` | Called when an existing credential's type changes. |\n| `credentials.create` | Called when someone creates a new credential. |\n| `credentialsList.dialogVisibleChanged` |  |\n| `dataDisplay.nodeTypeChanged` |  |\n| `dataDisplay.onDocumentationUrlClick` | Called when someone selects the help documentation link. |\n| `execution.open` | Called when an existing execution opens. |\n| `executionsList.openDialog` | Called when someone selects an execution from existing Workflow Executions. |\n| `expressionEdit.itemSelected` |  |\n| `expressionEdit.dialogVisibleChanged` |  |\n| `nodeCreateList.filteredNodeTypesComputed` |  |\n| `nodeCreateList.nodeFilterChanged` | Called when someone makes any changes to the node panel filter. |\n| `nodeCreateList.selectedTypeChanged` |  |\n| `nodeCreateList.mounted` |  |\n| `nodeCreateList.destroyed` |  |\n| `nodeSettings.credentialSelected` |  |\n| `nodeSettings.valueChanged` |  |\n| `nodeView.createNodeActiveChanged` |  |\n| `nodeView.addNodeButton` |  |\n| `nodeView.createNodeActiveChanged` |  |\n| `nodeView.mount` |  |\n| `pushConnection.executionFinished` |  |\n| `showMessage.showError` |  |\n| `runData.displayModeChanged` |  |\n| `workflow.activeChange` |  |\n| `workflow.activeChangeCurrent` |  |\n| `workflow.afterUpdate` | Called when someone updates an existing workflow. |\n| `workflow.open` |  |\n| `workflowRun.runError` |  |\n| `workflowRun.runWorkflow` | Called when a workflow executes. |\n| `workflowSettings.dialogVisibleChanged` |  |\n| `workflowSettings.saveSettings` | Called when someone saves the settings of a workflow. |\n\n### Registering hooks\n\nYou can set hooks by loading the hooks script on the page. One way to do this is by creating a hooks file in the project and adding a script tag in your `editor-ui/public/index.html` file:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"frontend-hooks.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Frontend hook files\n\nFrontend external hook files are regular JavaScript files which have the following format:\n\n```js\nwindow.n8nExternalHooks = {\n  nodeView: {\n    mount: [\n      function (store, meta) {\n        // do something\n      },\n    ],\n    createNodeActiveChanged: [\n      function (store, meta) {\n        // do something\n      },\n      function (store, meta) {\n        // do something else\n      },\n    ],\n    addNodeButton: [\n      function (store, meta) {\n        // do something\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Frontend hook functions\n\nYou can define multiple hook functions per hook. Each hook function is invoked with the following arguments arguments:\n\n* `store`: The Vuex store object. You can use this to change or get data from the store.\n* `metadata`: The object that contains any data provided by the hook. To see what's passed, search for the hook in the `editor-ui` package.",

    "managing-workflows.md": "---\n#https://www.notion.so/n8n/Frontmatter-432c2b8dff1f43d4b1c8d20075510fe4\ncontentType: howto\n---\n\n# Workflow management in Embed\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/embed-license.md\"\n\nWhen managing an embedded n8n deployment, spanning across teams or organizations, you will likely need to run the same (or similar) workflows for multiple users. There are two available options for doing so:\n\n| Solution | Pros | Cons |\n| -------- | ---- | ---- |\n| Create a workflow for each user | No limitation on how workflow starts (can use any trigger) | Requires managing multiple workflows. |\n| Create a single workflow, and pass it user credentials when executing | Simplified workflow management (only need to change one workflow). | To run the workflow, your product must call it |\n\n\n\n/// warning\nThe APIs referenced in this document are subject to change at any time. Be sure the check for continued functionality with each version upgrade.\n///\n\n## Workflow per user\n\nThere are three general steps to follow:\n\n* Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow.\n* Create the n8n credentials for this user.\n* Create the workflow.\n\n### 1. Obtain user credentials\n\nHere you need to capture all credentials for any node/service this user must authenticate with, along with any additional parameters required for the particular workflow. The credentials and any parameters needed will depend on your workflow and what you are trying to do.\n\n### 2. Create user credentials\n\nAfter all relevant credential details have been obtained, you can proceed to create the relevant service credentials in n8n. This can be done using the Editor UI or API call.\n\n\n#### Using the Editor UI\n\n1. From the menu select **Credentials** > **New**.\n1. Use the drop-down to select the **Credential type** to create, for example *Airtable*.\n    ![Create New Credentials drop-down](/_images/embed/managing-workflows/create_new_credentials.png)\n1. In the **Create New Credentials** modal, enter the corresponding credentials details for the user, and select the nodes that will have access to these credentials.\n    ![Create New Credentials modal](/_images/embed/managing-workflows/create_new_credentials2.png)\n1. Click **Create** to finish and save.\n\n#### Using the API\n\nThe frontend API used by the Editor UI can also be called to achieve the same result. The API endpoint is in the format: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials`.\n\nFor example, to create the credentials in the Editor UI example above, the request would be:\n```\nPOST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials\n```\n\nWith the request body:\n```json\n{\n   \"name\":\"MyAirtable\",\n   \"type\":\"airtableApi\",\n   \"nodesAccess\":[\n      {\n         \"nodeType\":\"n8n-nodes-base.airtable\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"data\":{\n      \"apiKey\":\"q12we34r5t67yu\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThe response will contain the ID of the new credentials, which you will use when creating the workflow for this user:\n```json\n{\n   \"data\":{\n      \"name\":\"MyAirtable\",\n      \"type\":\"airtableApi\",\n      \"data\":{\n         \"apiKey\":\"q12we34r5t67yu\"\n      },\n      \"nodesAccess\":[\n         {\n            \"nodeType\":\"n8n-nodes-base.airtable\",\n            \"date\":\"2021-09-10T07:41:27.770Z\"\n         }\n      ],\n      \"id\":\"29\",\n      \"createdAt\":\"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z\",\n      \"updatedAt\":\"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Create the workflow\n\nBest practice is to have a \u201cbase\u201d workflow that you then duplicate and customize for each new user with their credentials (and any other details).\n\nYou can duplicate and customize your template workflow using either the Editor UI or API call.\n\n#### Using the Editor UI\n\n1. From the menu select **Workflows** > **Open** to open the template workflow to be duplicated.\n\n1. Select **Workflows** > **Duplicate**, then enter a name for this new workflow and click **Save**.\n    ![Duplicate workflow](/_images/embed/managing-workflows/duplicate_workflow.png)\n\n1.

See [Create user credentials](#create-user-credentials) above.\n* Create the workflow.\n* Call the workflow as needed.\n\n### Create the workflow\n\nThe details and scope of this workflow will vary greatly according to the individual use case, however there are a few design implementations to keep in mind:\n\n* This workflow must be triggered by a [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.\n* The incoming webhook call must contain the user\u2019s credentials and any other workflow parameters required.\n* Each node where the user\u2019s credentials are needed should use an [expression](/code/expressions/) so that the node\u2019s credential field reads the credential provided in the webhook call.\n* Save and activate the workflow, ensuring the production URL is selected for the Webhook node. Refer to [webhook node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) for more information.\n\n### Call the workflow\n\nFor each new user, or for any existing user as may be needed, call the webhook defined as the workflow trigger and provide the necessary credentials (and any other workflow parameters).",

The process involves changing two packages in n8n's source code [github.com/n8n-io/n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n){:target=_blank .external-link}:\n\n* [packages/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/design-system){:target=_blank .external-link}: n8n's [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} design system with CSS styles and Vue.js components\n* [packages/editor-ui](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/editor-ui){:target=_blank .external-link}: n8n's [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} frontend build with [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev){:target=_blank .external-link}\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou need the following installed on your development machine:\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/prerequisites.md\"\n\nCreate a fork of [n8n's repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n){:target=_blank .external-link} and clone your new repository.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/n8n.git n8n\ncd n8n\n```\n\nInstall all dependencies, build and start n8n.\n\n```shell\nnpm install\nnpm run build\nnpm run start\n```\n\nWhenever you make changes you need to rebuild and restart n8n. While developing you can use `npm run dev` to automatically rebuild and restart n8n anytime you make code changes. \n\n## Theme colors\n\nTo customize theme colors open [packages/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/design-system){:target=_blank .external-link} and start with:\n\n- [packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.scss){:target=_blank .external-link}\n- [packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.dark.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.dark.scss){:target=_blank .external-link}\n\nAt the top of `_tokens.scss` you will find `--color-primary` variables as HSL colors:\n\n```scss\n@mixin theme {\n\t--color-primary-h: 6.9;\n\t--color-primary-s: 100%;\n\t--color-primary-l: 67.6%;\n```\n\nIn the following example the primary color changes to <span style=\"color:#0099ff\">#0099ff</span>. To convert to HSL you can use a [color converter tool](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n```scss\n@mixin theme {\n\t--color-primary-h: 204;\n\t--color-primary-s: 100%;\n\t--color-primary-l: 50%;\n```\n\n![Example Theme Color Customization](/_images/embed/white-label/color-transition.gif)\n\n\n## Theme logos\n\nTo change the editor\u2019s logo assets look into [packages/editor-ui/public](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/editor-ui/public){:target=_blank .external-link} and replace:\n\n- favicon-16x16.png\n- favicon-32x32.png\n- favicon.ico\n- n8n-logo.svg\n- n8n-logo-collapsed.svg\n- n8n-logo-expanded.svg\n\nReplace these logo assets. n8n uses them in Vue.js components, including:\n\n* [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue){:target=_blank .external-link}: top/left logo in the main sidebar.\n* [Logo.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/Logo.vue): reused in other components.\n\nIn the following example replace `n8n-logo-collapsed.svg` and `n8n-logo-expanded.svg` to update the main sidebar's logo assets.\n\n![Example Logo Main Sidebar](/_images/embed/white-label/logo-main-sidebar.png)\n\nIf your logo assets require different sizing or placement you can customize SCSS styles at the bottom of [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n```scss\n.logoItem {\n\tdisplay: flex;\n\tjustify-content: space-between;\n\theight: $header-height;\n\tline-height: $header-height;\n\tmargin: 0 !important;\n\tborder-radius: 0 !important;\n\tborder-bottom: var(--border-width-base) var(--border-style-base) var(--color-background-xlight);\n\tcursor: default;\n\n\t&:hover, &:global(.is-active):hover {\n\t\tbackground-color: initial !important;\n\t}\n\n\t* { vertical-align: middle; }\n\t.icon {\n\t\theight: 18px;\n\t\tposition: relative;\n\t\tleft: 6px;\n\t}\n\n}\n```\n\n## Text localization\n\nTo change all text occurrences like `n8n` or `n8n.io` to your brand identity you can customize n8n's English internationalization file: [packages/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\nn8n uses the [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/){:target=_blank .external-link} internationalization plugin for Vue.js to translate the majority of UI texts. To search and replace text occurrences inside `en.json` you can use [Linked locale messages](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/messages.html#linked-locale-messages){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\nIn the following example add the `_brand.name` translation key to white label n8n's [AboutModal.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/AboutModal.vue){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n```js\n{\n\t\"_brand.name\": \"My Brand\",\n\t//replace n8n with link to _brand.name\n\t\"about.aboutN8n\": \"About @:_brand.name\",\n\t\"about.n8nVersion\": \"@:_brand.name Version\",\n}\n```\n\n![Example About Modal Localization](/_images/embed/white-label/about-modal.png)\n\n### Window title\n\nTo change n8n's window title to your brand name, edit the following:\n\n- [packages/editor-ui/index.html](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/index.html){:target=_blank .external-link}\n- [packages/editor-ui/src/components/mixins/titleChange.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/mixins/titleChange.ts){:target=_blank .external-link}\n\nThe following example replaces all occurrences of `n8n` and `n8n.io` with `My Brand` in `index.html` and `titleChange.ts`.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n\t<!-- Replace html title attribute -->\n\t<title>My Brand - Workflow Automation</title>\n</head>\n```\n\n```typescript\n$titleSet(workflow: string, status: WorkflowTitleStatus) {\n\t// replace n8n prefix\n\twindow.document.title = `My Brand - ${icon} ${workflow}`;\n},\n\n$titleReset() {\n\t// replace n8n prefix\n\tdocument.title = `My Brand - Workflow Automation`;\n},\n```\n\n![Example Window Title Localization](/_images/embed/white-label/window-title.png)",

With an error workflow, you can control how n8n responds to a workflow execution failure.\n\n/// note | Investigating errors\nTo investigate failed executions, you can:\n\n* Review your [Executions](/workflows/executions/), for a [single workflow](/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/) or [all workflows you have access to](/workflows/executions/all-executions/). You can [load data from previous execution](/workflows/executions/debug/) into your current workflow.\n* Enable [Log streaming](/log-streaming/).\n///\n\n## Create and set an error workflow\n\nFor each workflow, you can set an error workflow in **Workflow Settings**. It runs if an execution fails. This means you can, for example, send email or Slack alerts when a workflow execution errors. The error workflow must start with the [Error Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/).\n\nYou can use the same error workflow for multiple workflows.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/flow-logic/create-set-error-workflow.md\"\n\n## Error data\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/error-trigger/error-data.md\"\n\n## Cause a workflow execution failure using Stop And Error\n\nWhen you create and set an error workflow, n8n runs it when an execution fails. Usually, this is due to things like errors in node settings, or the workflow running out of memory.\n\nYou can add the [Stop And Error](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to your workflow to force executions to fail under your chosen circumstances, and trigger the error workflow.",

If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.\n\nYou can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](/workflows/settings/).",
    "looping.md": "---\n#https://www.notion.so/n8n/Frontmatter-432c2b8dff1f43d4b1c8d20075510fe4\ncontentType: howto\n---\n\n# Looping in n8n\n\nLooping is useful when you want to process multiple items or perform an action repeatedly, such as sending a message to every contact in your address book. n8n handles this repetitive processing automatically, meaning you don't need to specifically build loops into your workflows. There are [some nodes](#node-exceptions) where this isn't true.\n\n## Using loops in n8n\n\nn8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point, or a single row in the output table of a node.\n\n![The Customer Datastore node output](/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png)\n\nNodes usually run once for each item. For example, if you wanted to send the name and notes of the customers in the Customer Datastore node as a message on Slack, you would:\n\n1. Connect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node.\n2. Configure the parameters.\n3. Execute the node. \n\nYou would receive five messages: one for each item.\n\nThis is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop.\n\n### Executing nodes once\n\nFor situations where you don't want a node to process all received items, for example sending a Slack message only to the first customer, you can do so by toggling the **Execute Once** parameter in the **Settings** tab of that node This setting is helpful when the incoming data contains multiple items and you want to only process the first one. \n\n\n## Creating loops\n\nn8n typically handles the iteration for all incoming items. However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. Refer to [Node exceptions](#node-exceptions) for a list of nodes that don't automatically iterate over all incoming items.\n\n### Loop until a condition is met\n\nTo create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Add an [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check when to stop the loop. \n\nHere is an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1130) that implements a loop with an `IF` node:\n\n![Editor UI view of sample workflow](/_images/flow-logic/looping/example_workflow.png)\n\n### Loop until all items are processed\n\nUse the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node when you want to loop until all items are processed. To process each item individually, set **Batch Size** to `1`.\n\nYou can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items.\n\nThe Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop.\n\n## Node exceptions\n\nNodes and operations where you need to design a loop into your workflow:\n\n* [CrateDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cratedb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.\n* [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode: processes all the items based on the entered code snippet.\n* [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode.\n* [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): you must handle pagination yourself. If your API call returns paginated results you must create a loop to fetch one page at a time.\n* [Microsoft SQL](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/) executes once for `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.\n* [MongoDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mongodb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.\n* [QuestDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.questdb/) executes once for `insert`.\n* [Redis](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redis/):\n\t* Info: this operation executes only once, regardless of the number of items in the incoming data.\n* [TimescaleDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.",

For a full list of available configurations see [Environment Variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).\n\n## Set environment variables by command line\n\n### npm\n\nFor npm, set your desired environment variables in terminal using the `export` command as shown below:\n\n```bash\nexport <variable>=<value>\n```\n\n### Docker\n\nIn Docker you can use the `-e` flag from the command line:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n --name n8n \\\n -p 5678:5678 \\\n -e N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=\"false\" \\\n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n\n```\n\n## Set environment variables using a file\n\nYou can also configure n8n using a configuration file.\n\nOnly define the values that need to be different from the default in your configuration file. You can use multiple files. For example, you can have a file with generic base settings, and files with specific values for different environments.\n\n### npm\n\nSet the path to the JSON configuration file using the environment variable `N8N_CONFIG_FILES`:\n\n```shell\n# Bash - Single file\nexport N8N_CONFIG_FILES=/<path-to-config>/my-config.json\n# Bash - Multiple files are comma-separated\nexport N8N_CONFIG_FILES=/<path-to-config>/my-config.json,/<path-to-config>/production.json\n\n# PowerShell - Single file, persist for current user\n# Note that setting scope (Process, User, Machine) has no effect on Unix systems\n[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('N8N_CONFIG_FILES', '<path-to-config>\\config.json', 'User')\n```\n\nExample file:\n\n```json\n{\n \"executions\": {\n  \"saveDataOnSuccess\": \"none\"\n },\n \"generic\": {\n  \"timezone\": \"Europe/Berlin\"\n },\n \"nodes\": {\n  \"exclude\": \"[\\\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\\\",\\\"n8n-nodes-base.writeBinaryFile\\\"]\"\n }\n}\n```\n\n/// note | Formatting as JSON\nYou can't always work out the correct JSON from the [Environment variables reference](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/). For example, to set `N8N_METRICS` to `true`, you need to do:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"endpoints\": {\n\t\t\"metrics\": {\n\t\t\t\"enable\": true\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nRefer to the [Schema file in the source code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/config/schema.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} for full details of the expected settings.\n///\n\n\n### Docker\n\nIn Docker, you can set your environment variables in the `n8n: environment:` element of your `docker-compose.yaml` file.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\nn8n:\n    environment:\n      - N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false\n```\n\n### Keeping sensitive data in separate files\n\nYou can append `_FILE` to individual environment variables to provide their configuration in a separate file, enabling you to avoid passing sensitive details using environment variables. n8n loads the data from the file with the given name, making it possible to load data from [Docker-Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Kubernetes-Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/){:target=_blank .external-link}. \n\nRefer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for details on each variable.\n\nWhile most environment variables can use the `_FILE` suffix, it's more beneficial for sensitive data such as credentials and database configuration. Here are some examples: \n\n```yaml\nCREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA_FILE=/path/to/credentials_data\nDB_TYPE_FILE=/path/to/db_type\nDB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE_FILE=/path/to/database_name\nDB_POSTGRESDB_HOST_FILE=/path/to/database_host\nDB_POSTGRESDB_PORT_FILE=/path/to/database_port\nDB_POSTGRESDB_USER_FILE=/path/to/database_user\nDB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD_FILE=/path/to/database_password\nDB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA_FILE=/path/to/database_schema\nDB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA_FILE=/path/to/ssl_ca\nDB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/ssl_cert\nDB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_KEY_FILE=/path/to/ssl_key\nDB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED_FILE=/path/to/ssl_reject_unauth\n```",

    "queue-mode.md": "---\n#https://www.notion.so/n8n/Frontmatter-432c2b8dff1f43d4b1c8d20075510fe4\ncontentType: howto\n---\n\n# Queue mode\n\nYou can run n8n in different modes depending on your needs. The queue mode provides the best scalability.\n\n/// note | Binary data storage\nn8n doesn't support queue mode with binary data storage. If your workflows need to persist binary data, you can't use queue mode.\n///\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen running in queue mode, you have multiple n8n instances set up, with one main instance receiving workflow information (such as triggers) and the worker instances performing the executions. \n\nEach worker is its own Node.js instance, running in `main` mode, but able to handle multiple simultaneous workflow executions due to their high IOPS (input-output operations per second). \n\nBy using worker instances and running in queue mode, you can scale n8n up (by adding workers) and down (by removing workers) as needed to handle the workload.\n\nThis is the process flow:\n\n1. The main n8n instance handles timers and webhook calls, generating (but not running) a workflow execution. \n1. It passes the execution ID to a message broker, [Redis](#start-redis), which maintains the queue of pending executions and allows the next available worker to pick them up.\n1. A worker in the pool picks up message from Redis.\n1. The worker uses the execution ID to get workflow information from the database.\n1. After completing the workflow execution, the worker:\n\t- Writes the results to the database.\n\t- Posts to Redis, saying that the execution has finished.\n1. Redis notifies the main instance.\n\n\n![\"Diagram showing the flow of data between the main n8n instance, Redis, the n8n workers, and the n8n database\"](/_images/hosting/scaling/queue-mode-flow.png)\n\n## Configuring workers\n\nWorkers are n8n instances that do the actual work. They receive information from the main n8n process about the workflows that have to get executed, execute the workflows, and update the status after each execution is complete.\n\n### Set encryption key\n\nn8n automatically generates an encryption key upon first startup. You can also provide your own custom key using [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) if desired.\n\nThe encryption key of the main n8n instance must be shared with all worker and webhooks processor nodes to ensure these worker nodes are able to access credentials stored in the database.\n\nSet the encryption key for each worker node in a [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) or by setting the corresponding environment variable:\n\n```bash\nexport N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<main_instance_encryption_key>\n```\n\n### Set executions mode\n\n/// note | Database considerations\nn8n recommends using Postgres 13+. Running n8n with execution mode set to `queue` with an SQLite database isn't recommended.\n///\n\nSet the environment variable `EXECUTIONS_MODE` to `queue` using the following command.\n\n```bash\nexport EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set `executions.mode` to `queue` in the [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).\n\n### Start Redis\n\n/// note | Running Redis on a separate machine\nYou can run Redis on a separate machine, just make sure that it's accessible by the n8n instance.\n///\n\nTo run Redis in a Docker container, follow the instructions below:\n\nRun the following command to start a Redis instance:\n\n```\ndocker run --name some-redis -p 6379:6379  -d redis\n```\n\nBy default, Redis runs on `localhost` on port `6379` with no password. Based on your Redis configuration, set the following configurations for the main n8n process. These will allow n8n to interact with Redis.\n\n| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |\n| ------ | ------ | ----- |\n| `queue.bull.redis.host:localhost` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST=localhost` | By default, Redis runs on `localhost`. |\n| `queue.bull.redis.port:6379` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT=6379` | The default port is `6379`. If Redis is running on a different port, configure the value. |\n\nYou can also set the following optional configurations:\n\n| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |\n| ------ | ------ | ----- |\n| `queue.bull.redis.username:USERNAME` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_USERNAME` | By default, Redis doesn't require a username. If you're using a specific user, configure it variable. |\n| `queue.bull.redis.password:PASSWORD` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD` | By default, Redis doesn't require a password. If you're using a password, configure it variable. |\n| `queue.bull.redis.db:0` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_DB` | The default value is `0`. If you change this value, update the configuration. |\n| `queue.bull.redis.timeoutThreshold:10000ms` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD` | Tells n8n how long it should wait if Redis is unavailable before exiting. The default value is `10000` (ms). |\n| `queue.bull.gracefulShutdownTimeout:30` | `N8N_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | A graceful shutdown timeout for workers to finish executing jobs before terminating the process. The default value is `30` seconds. |\n\n\nNow you can start your n8n instance and it will connect to your Redis instance.\n\n### Start workers\n\nYou will need to start worker processes to allow n8n to execute workflows. If you want to host workers on a separate machine, install n8n on the machine and make sure that it's connected to your Redis instance and the n8n database.\n\nStart worker processes by running the following command from the root directory:\n\n```\n./packages/cli/bin/n8n worker\n```\n\nIf you're using Docker, use the following command:\n\n```\ndocker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n worker\n```\n\nYou can set up multiple worker processes. Make sure that all the worker processes have access to Redis and the n8n database.\n\n#### Worker server\n\nEach worker process runs a server that exposes optional endpoints:\n\n- `/healthz`: returns whether the worker is up, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable\n- `/healthz/readiness`: returns whether worker's DB and Redis connections are ready, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable\n- [credentials overwrite endpoint](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#credential-overwrites)\n- [`/metrics`](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/)\n\n#### View running workers \n\n/// info | Feature availability\n* Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.\n* If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n///\n\nYou can view running workers and their performance metrics in n8n by selecting **Settings** > **Workers**.\n\n## Running n8n with queues\n\nWhen running n8n with queues, all the production workflow executions get processed by worker processes. This means that even the webhook calls get delegated to the worker processes, which might add some overhead and extra latency.\n\nRedis acts as the message broker, and the database persists data, so access to both is required. Running a distributed system with this setup over SQLite isn't supported.\n\n/// note | Migrate data\nIf you want to migrate data from one database to another, you can use the Export and Import commands. Refer to the [CLI commands for n8n](/hosting/cli-commands/#export-workflows-and-credentials) documentation to learn how to use these commands.\n///\n\n## Webhook processors\n\n/// note | Keep in mind\nWebhook processes rely on Redis too. Follow the [configure the workers](#configuring-workers) section above to setup webhook processor nodes.\n///\n\nWebhook processors are another layer of scaling in n8n. Configuring the webhook processor is optional, and allows you to scale the incoming webhook requests.\n\nThis method allows n8n to process a huge number of parallel requests. All you have to do is add more webhook processes and workers accordingly. The webhook process will listen to requests on the same port (default: `5678`). Run these processes in containers or separate machines, and have a load balancing system to route requests accordingly.\n\nn8n doesn't recommend adding the main process to the load balancer pool. If you add the main process to the pool, it will receive requests and possibly a heavy load. This will result in degraded performance for editing, viewing, and interacting with the n8n UI.\n\nYou can start the webhook processor by executing the following command from the root directory:\n\n```\n./packages/cli/bin/n8n webhook\n```\n\nIf you're using Docker, use the following command:\n\n```\ndocker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n webhook\n```\n\n### Configure webhook URL\n\nTo configure your webhook URL, execute the following command on the machine running the main n8n instance:\n\n```bash\nexport WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-url.com\n```\n\nYou can also set this value in the configuration file.\n\n### Configure load balancer\n\nWhen using multiple webhook processes you will need a load balancer to route requests. If you are using the same domain name for your n8n instance and the webhooks, you can set up your load balancer to route requests as follows:\n\n- Redirect any request that matches `/webhook/*` to the webhook servers pool\n- All other paths (the n8n internal API, the static files for the editor, etc.) should get routed to the main process\n\n**Note:** The default URL for manual workflow executions is `/webhook-test/*`. Make sure that these URLs route to your main process.\n\nYou can change this path in the configuration file `endpoints.webhook` or using the `N8N_ENDPOINT_WEBHOOK` environment variable. If you change these, update your load balancer accordingly.\n\n### Disable webhook processing in the main process (optional)\n\nYou have webhook processors to execute the workflows. You can disable the webhook processing in the main process. This will make sure to execute all webhook executions in the webhook processors. In the configuration file set `endpoints.disableProductionWebhooksOnMainProcess` to `true` so that n8n doesn't process webhook requests on the main process.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nexport N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS=true\n```\n\nWhen disabling the webhook process in the main process, run the main process and don't add it to the load balancer's webhook pool.\n\n## Configure worker concurrency\n\nYou can define the number of jobs a worker can run in parallel by using the `concurrency` flag. It defaults to `10`. To change it:\n\n```bash\nn8n worker --concurrency=5\n```\n\n## Multi-main setup\n\n/// info | Feature availability\n* Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.\n* If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n///\n\nIn queue mode you can run more than one `main` process for high availability.\n\nIn a single-mode setup, the `main` process does two sets of tasks: \n\n- **regular tasks**, such as running the API, serving the UI, and listening for webhooks, and \n- **at-most-once tasks**, such as running non-HTTP triggers (timers, pollers, and persistent connections like RabbitMQ and IMAP), and pruning executions and binary data.\n\nIn a multi-main setup, there are two kinds of `main` processes:\n\n- **followers**, which run **regular tasks**, and\n- the **leader**, which runs **both regular and at-most-once tasks**.\n\n### Leader designation\n\nIn a multi-main setup, all main instances handle the leadership process transparently to users. In case the current leader becomes unavailable, for example because it crashed or its event loop became too busy, other followers can take over. If the previous leader becomes responsive again, it becomes a follower.\n\n### Configuring multi-main setup\n\nTo deploy n8n in multi-main setup, ensure: \n\n- All `main` processes are running in queue mode and are connected to Postgres and Redis.\n- All `main` and `worker` processes are running the same version of n8n.\n- All `main` processes have set the environment variable `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_ENABLED` to `true`.\n- All `main` processes are running behind a load balancer with session persistence (sticky sessions) enabled.\n\nIf needed, you can adjust the leader key options:\n\n| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |\n| ------ | ------ | ----- |\n| `multiMainSetup.ttl:10` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_KEY_TTL=10` | Time to live (in seconds) for leader key in multi-main setup. |\n| `multiMainSetup.interval:3` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_CHECK_INTERVAL=3` | Interval (in seconds) for leader check in multi-main setup. |\n\n/// note | Keep in mind\nIn multi-main setup, all `main` processes listen for webhooks, so they fulfill the same purpose as `webhook` processes. Running `webhook` processes is neither needed nor allowed in multi-main setup.\n///",

Linux users must install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) individually for your distribution.\n///\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md\"\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md\"\n\n## Starting n8n\n\nFrom your terminal, run:\n\n```sh\ndocker volume create n8n_data\n\ndocker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n\n```\n\nThis command will download all required n8n images and start your container, exposed on port `5678`. To save your work between container restarts, it also mounts a docker volume, `n8n_data`, to persist your data locally.\n\nYou can then access n8n by opening:\n[http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)\n\n## Using alternate databases\n\nBy default n8n uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions and workflows. n8n also supports PostgresDB configurable using environment variables as detailed below.\n\nIt's important to still persist data in the `/home/node/.n8n` folder as it contains n8n user data and even more importantly the encryption key for credentials. It's also the name of the webhook when the n8n tunnel is used.\n\nIf no directory is found, n8n creates automatically one on\nstartup. In this case, existing credentials saved with a different encryption key can not be used anymore.\n\n/// note | Keep in mind\nPersisting the `/home/node/.n8n` directory even when using alternate databases is the recommended best practice, but not explicitly required. The encryption key can be provided using the `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).\n///\n### PostgresDB\n\nTo use n8n with Postgres, provide the corresponding:\n\n```sh\ndocker volume create n8n_data\n\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n --name n8n \\\n -p 5678:5678 \\\n -e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \\\n -e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \\\n -e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \\\n -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=<POSTGRES_PORT> \\\n -e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \\\n -e DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=<POSTGRES_SCHEMA> \\\n -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \\\n -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \\\n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n\n```\n\nA complete `docker-compose` file for Postgres can be found [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting/tree/main/docker-compose/withPostgres).\n\n## Setting timezone\n\nTo define the timezone n8n should use, the environment variable `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` can be set. This gets used by schedule based nodes such as the Cron node.\n\nThe timezone of the system can also be set separately. This controls what\nsome scripts and commands return like `$ date`. The system timezone can be set using the environment variable `TZ`.\n\nExample using the same timezone for both:\n\n```sh\ndocker volume create n8n_data\n\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n --name n8n \\\n -p 5678:5678 \\\n -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE=\"Europe/Berlin\" \\\n -e TZ=\"Europe/Berlin\" \\\n -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \\\n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n\n```\n\n## Updating\n\nFrom your Docker Desktop, navigate to the **Images** tab and select **Pull** from the context menu to download the latest n8n image:\n\n![Docker Desktop](/_images/hosting/installation/docker/docker_desktop.png)\n\nYou can also use the command line to pull the latest, or a specific version:\n\n```sh\n# Pull latest (stable) version\ndocker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n\n\n# Pull specific version\ndocker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:0.220.1\n\n# Pull next (unstable) version\ndocker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:next\n```\n\nStop the container and start it again. You can also use the command line:\n\n```sh\n# Get the container ID\ndocker ps -a\n\n# Stop the container with ID container_id\ndocker stop [container_id]\n\n# Remove the container with ID container_id\ndocker rm [container_id]\n\n# Start the container\ndocker run --name=[container_name] [options] -d docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n\n```\n\n### Docker Compose\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/docker-compose-updating.md\"\n\n## Further reading\n\nMore information about Docker setup can be found in the README file of the [Docker Image](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/docker/images/n8n).\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/tunnel.md\"\n\nStart n8n with `--tunnel` by running:\n\n```sh\ndocker volume create n8n_data\n\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n --name n8n \\\n -p 5678:5678 \\\n -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \\\n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n \\\n start --tunnel\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/server-setups-next-steps.md\"",

It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou need [The Azure command line tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link}\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md\"\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md\"\n\n## Hosting options\n\nAzure offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including Azure Container Instances (optimized for running containers), Linux Virtual Machines, and Azure Kubernetes Service (containers running with Kubernetes).\n\nThis guide uses the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.\n\nThe steps in this guide use a mix of the Azure UI and command line tool, but you can use either to accomplish most tasks.\n\n## Open the Azure Kubernetes Service\n\nFrom [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} select **Kubernetes services**.\n\n## Create a cluster\n\nFrom the Kubernetes services page, select **Create** > **Create a Kubernetes cluster**.\n\nYou can select any of the configuration options that suit your needs, then select **Create** when done.\n\n## Set Kubectl context\n\nThe remainder of the steps in this guide require you to set the Azure instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and then the **Connect** button. The resulting code snippets shows the steps to paste and run into a terminal to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new cluster.\n\n## Clone configuration repository\n\nKubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/azure){:target=_blank .external-link}. The following steps tell you which file configures what and what you need to change.\n\nClone the repository with the following command:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b azure\n```\n\nAnd change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:\n\n```shell\ncd azure\n```\n\n## Configure Postgres\n\nFor larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.\n\n### Configure volume for persistent storage\n\nTo maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default storage class is suitable for this purpose and is defined in the `postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.\n\n/// note | Specialized storage classes\nIf you have specialised or higher requirements for storage classes, [read more on the options Azure offers in the documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-storage#storage-classes){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link}.\n///\n### Postgres environment variables\n\nPostgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.\n\nThe example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..\n\nThe `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.\n\n## Configure n8n\n\n### Create a volume for file storage\n\nWhile not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:\n\n* Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.\n* If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.\n\nThe `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.\n\n```yaml\n\u2026\nvolumes:\n  - name: n8n-claim0\n    persistentVolumeClaim:\n      claimName: n8n-claim0\n\u2026\n```\n\n### Pod resources\n\n[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\n\u2026\nresources:\n  requests:\n    memory: \"250Mi\"\n  limits:\n    memory: \"500Mi\"\n\u2026    \n```\n\nThis defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/suggested-pod-resources.md\"\n\n### Optional: Environment variables\n\nYou can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.\n\nCreate an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.\n\nThe manifests define the following:\n\n- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod\n- Define the container image to use\n- Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object\n- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.\n- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.\n\n## Services\n\nThe two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.\n\n## Send to Kubernetes cluster\n\nSend all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:\n\n```shell\nkubectl apply -f .\n```\n\n/// note | Namespace error\nYou may see an error message about not finding an \"n8n\" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:\n\n```shell\nkubectl apply -f namespace.yaml\n```\n///\n\n\n## Set up DNS\n\nn8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & ingresses** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **External IP** column. You need to add the n8n port, \"5678\" to the URL.\n\n/// note | Static IP addresses with AKS\n[Read this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/static-ip){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} for more details on how to use a static IP address with AKS.\n///\n## Delete resources\n\nRemove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:\n\n```shell\nkubectl delete -f .\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/server-setups-next-steps.md\"",

It uses:\n\n* [Caddy](http://caddyserver.com){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Droplet from the internet. Caddy will also automatically create and manage SSL / TLS certificates for your n8n instance.\n* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} to create and define the application components and how they work together.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md\"\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md\"\n\n## Create a Droplet\n\n1. [Log in](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login){:target=_blank .external-link} to DigitalOcean. \n2. Select the project to host the Droplet, or [create a new project](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/projects/how-to/create/){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n3. In your project, select **Droplets** from the **Manage** menu. \n4. [Create a new Droplet](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/create/){:target=_blank .external-link} using the [Docker image](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/docker){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} available on the **Marketplace** tab.\n\n/// note | Droplet resources\nWhen creating the Droplet, DigitalOcean asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, a basic shared CPU plan is enough.\n///\n/// note | SSH key or Password\nDigitalOcean lets you choose between SSH key and password-based authentication. SSH keys are considered more secure.\n///\n## Log in to your Droplet and create new user\n\nThe rest of this guide requires you to log in to the Droplet using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [How to Connect to Droplets with SSH](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} for more information.\n\nYou should create a new user, to avoid working as the root user:\n\n1. Log in as root.\n2. Create a new user:\n\t```shell\n\tadduser <username>\n\t```\n3. Follow the prompts in the CLI to finish creating the user.\n4. Grant the new user administrative privileges:\n\t```shell\n\tusermod -aG sudo <username>\n\t```\n\tYou can now run commands with superuser privileges by using `sudo` before the command.\n5. Follow the steps to set up SSH for the new user: [Add Public Key Authentication](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04#step-four-add-public-key-authentication-recommended){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n5. Log out of the droplet.\n6. Log in using SSH as the new user.\n\n## Clone configuration repository\n\nDocker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy){:target=_blank .external-link} into the home folder of the logged-in user on your Droplet. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.\n\nClone the repository with the following command:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git\n```\n\nAnd change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:\n\n```shell\ncd n8n-docker-caddy\n```\n\n## Default folders and files\n\nThe host operating system (the DigitalOcean Droplet) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:\n\n- `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.\n- `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.\n\n### Create Docker volumes\n\nTo persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} that Docker reuses between restarts:\n\n```shell\nsudo docker volume create caddy_data\n```\n\nCreate a Docker volume for the n8n data:\n\n```shell\nsudo docker volume create n8n_data\n```\n\n## Set up DNS\n\nn8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the Droplet. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new \"A\" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link}.\n\n## Open ports\n\nn8n runs as a web application, so the Droplet needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.\n\nOpen the following ports in the Droplet's firewall by running the following two commands:\n\n```shell\nsudo ufw allow 80\nsudo ufw allow 443\n```\n\n## Configure n8n\n\nn8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.\n\nOpen the file with the following command:\n\n```shell\nnano .env\n```\n\nThe file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.\n\nRefer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.\n\n## The Docker Compose file\n\nThe Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.\n\n- The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.\n- The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.\n\nThe Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:\n\n```shell\nnano docker-compose.yml\n```\n\n## Configure Caddy\n\nCaddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.\n\n```shell\nnano caddy_config/Caddyfile\n```\n\nChange the placeholder domain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:\n\n```text\nn8n.<domain>.<suffix> {\n    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {\n      flush_interval -1\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you were to use `automate.example.com`, your `Caddyfile` may look something like:\n\n```text\nautomate.example.com {\n    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {\n      flush_interval -1\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Start Docker Compose\n\nStart n8n and Caddy with the following command:\n\n```shell\nsudo docker compose up -d\n```\n\nThis may take a few minutes.\n\n## Test your setup\n\nIn your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.\n\n## Stop n8n and Caddy\n\nYou can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:\n\n```shell\nsudo docker compose stop\n```\n## Updating\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/docker-compose-updating.md\"\n\n## Next steps\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/server-setups-next-steps.md\"",

The following example is for Ubuntu:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg\necho \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\n```\n\n### 2. Optional: Non-root user access\n\nRun when logged in as the user that should also be allowed to run docker:\n\n```bash\nsudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}\nsu - ${USER}\n```\n\n### 3. Install Docker-Compose\n\nThis can vary depending on the Linux distribution used. You can find detailed instructions in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\nThe example below is for Ubuntu:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin\n```\n\n### 4. DNS setup\n\nAdd A record to route the subdomain accordingly:\n\n```\nType: A\nName: n8n (or the desired subdomain)\nIP address: <IP_OF_YOUR_SERVER>\n```\n\n### 5. Create Docker Compose file\n\nCreate a `docker-compose.yml` file. Paste the following in the file:\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"3.7\"\n\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    image: \"traefik\"\n    restart: always\n    command:\n      - \"--api=true\"\n      - \"--api.insecure=true\"\n      - \"--providers.docker=true\"\n      - \"--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false\"\n      - \"--entrypoints.web.address=:80\"\n      - \"--entrypoints.web.http.redirections.entryPoint.to=websecure\"\n      - \"--entrypoints.web.http.redirections.entrypoint.scheme=https\"\n      - \"--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443\"\n      - \"--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.tlschallenge=true\"\n      - \"--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.email=${SSL_EMAIL}\"\n      - \"--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json\"\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n      - \"443:443\"\n    volumes:\n      - traefik_data:/letsencrypt\n      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\n\n  n8n:\n    image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n\n    restart: always\n    ports:\n      - \"127.0.0.1:5678:5678\"\n    labels:\n      - traefik.enable=true\n      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.rule=Host(`${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}`)\n      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.tls=true\n      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.entrypoints=web,websecure\n      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.tls.certresolver=mytlschallenge\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.SSLRedirect=true\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSSeconds=315360000\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.browserXSSFilter=true\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.contentTypeNosniff=true\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.forceSTSHeader=true\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.SSLHost=${DOMAIN_NAME}\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSIncludeSubdomains=true\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSPreload=true\n      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.middlewares=n8n@docker\n    environment:\n      - N8N_HOST=${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}\n      - N8N_PORT=5678\n      - N8N_PROTOCOL=https\n      - NODE_ENV=production\n      - WEBHOOK_URL=https://${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}/\n      - GENERIC_TIMEZONE=${GENERIC_TIMEZONE}\n    volumes:\n      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n\n\nvolumes:\n  traefik_data:\n    external: true\n  n8n_data:\n    external: true\n```\n\nIf you are planning on reading/writing local files with n8n (for example, by using the [Read/Write Files from Disk node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/), you will need to configure a data directory for those files here. If you are running n8n as a root user, add this under `volumes` for the n8n service:\n\n```yaml\n- /local-files:/files\n```\n\nIf you are running n8n as a non-root user, add this under `volumes` for the n8n service:\n\n```yaml\n- /home/<YOUR USERNAME>/n8n-local-files:/files\n```\n\nYou will now be able to write files to the `/files` directory in n8n and they will appear on your server in either `/local-files` or `/home/<YOUR USERNAME>/n8n-local-files`, respectively.\n\n### 6. Create `.env` file\n\nCreate an `.env` file and change it accordingly.\n\n```bash\n# The top level domain to serve from\nDOMAIN_NAME=example.com\n\n# The subdomain to serve from\nSUBDOMAIN=n8n\n\n# DOMAIN_NAME and SUBDOMAIN combined decide where n8n will be reachable from\n# above example would result in: https://n8n.example.com\n\n# Optional timezone to set which gets used by Cron-Node by default\n# If not set New York time will be used\nGENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin\n\n# The email address to use for the SSL certificate creation\nSSL_EMAIL=user@example.com\n```\n\n### 7. Create data folder\n\nCreate the Docker volume that's defined as `n8n_data`. n8n will save the database file from SQLite and the encryption key in this volume.\n\n```sh\nsudo docker volume create n8n_data\n```\n\nCreate a volume for the Traefik data, This is defined as `traefik_data`.\n\n\n```sh\nsudo docker volume create traefik_data\n```\n\n### 8. Start Docker Compose\n\nn8n can now be started via:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker compose up -d\n```\n\nTo stop the container:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker compose stop\n```\n\n### 9. Done\n\nn8n will now be reachable using the above defined subdomain + domain combination.\nThe above example would result in: `https://n8n.example.com`\n\nn8n will only be reachable using `https` and not using `http`.\n\n/// warning | Secure your n8n instance\nMake sure that you [set up authentication](/hosting/user-management/) for your n8n instance.\n///\n## Next steps\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/server-setups-next-steps.md\"",

It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- The [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link}\n- The [gke-gcloud-auth-plugin](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} (install the gcloud CLI first)\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md\"\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md\"\n\n## Hosting options\n\nGoogle Cloud offers several options suitable for hosting n8n, including Cloud Run (optimized for running containers), Compute Engine (VMs), and Kubernetes Engine (containers running with Kubernetes).\n\nThis guide uses the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.\n\nMost of the steps in this guide use the Google Cloud UI, but you can also use the [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} instead to undertake all the steps.\n\n## Create project\n\nGCP encourages you to create projects to logically organize resources and configuration. Create a new project for your n8n deployment from your Google Cloud Console: select the project dropdown menu and then the **NEW PROJECT** button. Then select the newly created project. As you follow the other steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct project selected.\n\n## Enable the Kubernetes Engine API\n\nGKE isn't enabled by default. Search for \"Kubernetes\" in the top search bar and select \"Kubernetes Engine\" from the results.\n\nSelect **ENABLE** to enable the Kubernetes Engine API for this project.\n\n## Create a cluster\n\nFrom the [GKE service page](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview){:target=_blank .external-link}, select **Clusters** > **CREATE**. Make sure you select the \"Standard\" cluster option, n8n doesn't work with an \"Autopilot\" cluster. You can leave the cluster configuration on defaults unless there's anything specifically you need to change, such as location.\n\n## Set Kubectl context\n\nThe rest of the steps in this guide require you to set the GCP instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and selecting **CONNECT**. The displayed code snippet shows a connection string for the gcloud CLI tool. Paste and run the code snippet in the gcloud CLI to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new gcloud cluster.\n\n## Clone configuration repository\n\nKubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/gcp){:target=_blank .external-link} locally. The following steps explain the file configuration and how to add your information.\n\nClone the repository with the following command:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b gcp\n```\n\nAnd change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:\n\n```shell\ncd n8n-kubernetes-hosting\n```\n\n## Configure Postgres\n\nFor larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.\n\n### Create a volume for persistent storage\n\nTo maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. Running Postgres on GCP requires a specific Kubernetes Storage Class. You can read [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/deploying-highly-available-postgresql-with-gke){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} for specifics, but the `storage.yaml` manifest creates it for you. You may want to change the regions to create the storage in under the `allowedTopologies` > `matchedLabelExpressions` > `values` key. By default, they're set to `us-central`.\n\n```yaml\n\u2026\nallowedTopologies:\n  - matchLabelExpressions:\n      - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone\n        values:\n          - us-central1-b\n          - us-central1-c\n```\n\n### Postgres environment variables\n\nPostgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.\n\nThe example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..\n\nThe `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.\n\n## Configure n8n\n\n### Create a volume for file storage\n\nWhile not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:\n\n* Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.\n* If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.\n\nThe `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.\n\n```yaml\n\u2026\nvolumes:\n  - name: n8n-claim0\n    persistentVolumeClaim:\n      claimName: n8n-claim0\n\u2026\n```\n\n### Pod resources\n\n[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml` files:\n\n```yaml\n\u2026\nresources:\n  requests:\n    memory: \"250Mi\"\n  limits:\n    memory: \"500Mi\"\n\u2026    \n```\n\nThis defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/suggested-pod-resources.md\"\n\n### Optional: Environment variables\n\nYou can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.\n\nCreate an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.\n\nThe manifests define the following:\n\n- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod\n- Define the container image to use\n- Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object\n- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.\n- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.\n\n## Services\n\nThe two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.\n\n## Send to Kubernetes cluster\n\nSend all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:\n\n```shell\nkubectl apply -f .\n```\n\n/// note | Namespace error\nYou may see an error message about not finding an \"n8n\" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:\n\n```shell\nkubectl apply -f namespace.yaml\n```\n///\n\n\n## Set up DNS\n\nn8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & Ingress** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **Endpoints** column.\n\n/// note | GKE and IP addresses\n[Read this GKE tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/configuring-domain-name-static-ip#configuring_your_domain_name_records){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} for more details on how reserved IP addresses work with GKE and Kubernetes resources.\n///\n## Delete resources\n\nRemove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:\n\n```shell\nkubectl delete -f .\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/server-setups-next-steps.md\"",

It uses:\n\n\n- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} to create and define the application components and how they work together.\n- [Heroku's PostgreSQL service](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/heroku-postgres){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} to host n8n's data storage.\n- A **Deploy to Heroku** button offering a one click, with minor configuration, deployment.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md\"\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md\"\n\n\n## Use the deployment template to create a Heroku project\n\nThe quickest way to get started with deploying n8n to Heroku is using the **Deploy to Heroku** button:\n\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku/tree/main)\n\nThis opens the **Create New App** page on Heroku. Set a name for the project, and choose the region to deploy the project to.\n\n### Configure environment variables\n\nHeroku pre-fills the configuration options defined in the `env` section of the `app.json` file, which also sets default values for the environment variables n8n uses.\n\nYou can change any of these values to suit your needs. You must change the following values:\n\n- **N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY**, which n8n uses to [encrypt user account details](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) before saving to the database.\n- **WEBHOOK_URL** should match the application name you create to ensure that webhooks have the correct URL.\n\n### Deploy n8n\n\nSelect **Deploy app**.\n\nAfter Heroku builds and deploys the app it provides links to **Manage App** or **View** the application.\n\n/// note | Heroku and DNS\nRefer to the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/networking-dns){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} to find out how to connect your domain to a Heroku application.\n///\n## Changing the deployment template\n\nYou can make changes to the deployment template by forking the [repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku){:target=_blank .external-link} and deploying from you fork.\n\n### The Dockerfile\n\nBy default the Dockerfile pulls the latest n8n image, if you want to use a different or fixed version, then update the image tag on the top line of the `Dockerfile`.\n\n### Heroku and exposing ports\n\nHeroku doesn't allow Docker-based applications to define an exposed port with the `EXPOSE` command. Instead, Heroku provides a `PORT` environment variable that it dynamically populates at application runtime. The `entrypoint.sh` file overrides the default Docker image command to instead set the port variable that Heroku provides. You can then access n8n on port 80 in a web browser.\n\n/// note | Docker limitations with Heroku\n[Read this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime#unsupported-dockerfile-commands){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} for more details on the limitations of using Docker with Heroku.\n///\n### Configuring Heroku\n\nThe `heroku.yml` file defines the application you want to create on Heroku. It consists of two sections:\n\n* `setup` > `addons` defines the Heroku addons to use. In this case, the PostgreSQL database addon.\n* The `build` section defines how Heroku builds the application. In this case it uses the Docker buildpack to build a `web` service based on the supplied `Dockerfile`.\n\n## Next steps\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/server-setups-next-steps.md\"",

It uses:\n\n* [Caddy](http://caddyserver.com){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Server from the internet.\n* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} to create and define the application components and how they work together.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md\"\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md\"\n\n## Create a server\n\n1. [Log in](https://console.hetzner.cloud/){:target=_blank .external-link} to the Hetzner Cloud Console.\n2. Select the project to host the server, or create a new project by selecting **+ NEW PROJECT**.\n3. Select **+ CREATE SERVER** on the project tile you want to add it to.\n\nYou can change most of the settings to suit your needs, but as this guide uses Docker to run the application, under the **Image** section, select \"Docker CE\" from the **APPS** tab.\n\n/// note | Type\nWhen creating the server, Hetzner asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, the CPX11 type is enough.\n///\n/// note | SSH keys\nHetzner lets you choose between SSH and password-based authentication. SSH is more secure. The rest of this guide assumes you are using SSH.\n///\n## Log in to your server\n\nThe rest of this guide requires you to log in to the server using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [Access with SSH/rsync/BorgBackup](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/access/access-ssh-rsync-borg){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} for more information. You can find the public IP in the listing of the servers in your project.\n\n## Install Docker Compose\n\nThe Hetzner Docker app image doesn't have Docker compose installed. Install it with the following commands:\n\n```shell\napt update && apt -y upgrade\napt install docker-compose-plugin\n```\n\n## Clone configuration repository\n\nDocker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy){:target=_blank .external-link} into the root user folder of the server. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.\n\nClone the repository with the following command:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git\n```\n\nAnd change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:\n\n```shell\ncd n8n-docker-caddy\n```\n\n## Default folders and files\n\nThe host operating system (the server) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:\n\n- `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.\n- `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.\n\n### Create Docker volume\n\nTo persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} that Docker reuses between restarts:\n\n```shell\ndocker volume create caddy_data\n```\n\nCreate a Docker volume for the n8n data:\n\n```shell\nsudo docker volume create n8n_data\n```\n\n## Set up DNS\n\nn8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the server. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new \"A\" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link}.\n\n## Open ports\n\nn8n runs as a web application, so the server needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.\n\nOpen the following ports in the server's firewall by running the following two commands:\n\n```shell\nsudo ufw allow 80\nsudo ufw allow 443\n```\n\n## Configure n8n\n\nn8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.\n\nOpen the file with the following command:\n\n```shell\nnano .env\n```\n\nThe file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.\n\nRefer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.\n\n## The Docker Compose file\n\nThe Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.\n\n- The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.\n- The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.\n\nThe Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:\n\n```shell\nnano docker-compose.yml\n```\n\n## Configure Caddy\n\nCaddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.\n\n```shell\nnano caddy_config/Caddyfile\n```\n\nChange the placeholder subdomain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:\n\n```text\nn8n.<domain>.<suffix> {\n    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {\n      flush_interval -1\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Start Docker Compose\n\nStart n8n and Caddy with the following command:\n\n```shell\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nThis may take a few minutes.\n\n## Test your setup\n\nIn your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.\n\n## Stop n8n and Caddy\n\nYou can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:\n\n```shell\nsudo docker compose stop\n```\n\n## Updating\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/docker-compose-updating.md\"\n\n## Next steps\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/installation/server-setups-next-steps.md\"",

This value should be set when using workers. |\n\n\n```bash\n# Set the logging level to 'debug'\nexport N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug\n\n# Set log output to both console and a log file\nexport N8N_LOG_OUTPUT=console,file\n\n# Set a save location for the log file\nexport N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION=/home/jim/n8n/logs/n8n.log\n\n# Set a 50 MB maximum size for each log file\nexport N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXSIZE=50\n\n# Set 60 as the maximum number of log files to be kept\nexport N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXCOUNT=60\n```\n\n### Log levels\n\nn8n uses standard log levels to report:\n\n- `silent`: outputs nothing at all\n- `error`: outputs only errors and nothing else\n- `warn`: outputs errors and warning messages\n- `info`: contains useful information about progress\n- `debug`: the most verbose output. n8n outputs a lot of information to help you debug issues.\n\n\n## Development\n\nDuring development, adding log messages is a good practice. It assists in debugging errors. To configure logging for development, follow the guide below.\n\n### Implementation details\n\nn8n uses the `LoggerProxy` class, located in the `workflow` package. Calling the `LoggerProxy.init()` by passing in an instance of `Logger`, initializes the class before the usage.\n\nThe initialization process happens only once. The [`start.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/commands/start.ts) file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the `LoggerProxy` class.\n\nOnce the `Logger` implementation gets created in the `cli` package, it can be obtained by calling the `getInstance` convenience method from the exported module.\n\nCheck the [start.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/commands/start.ts) file to learn more about how this process works.\n\n### Adding logs\n\nOnce the `LoggerProxy` class gets initialized in the project, you can import it to any other file and add logs.\n\nConvenience methods are provided for all logging levels, so new logs can be added whenever needed using the format `Logger.<logLevel>('<message>', ...meta)`, where `meta` represents any additional properties desired beyond `message`.\n\nIn the example above, we use the standard log levels described [above](#log-levels). The `message` argument is a string, and `meta` is a data object.\n\n```js\n// You have to import the LoggerProxy. We rename it to Logger to make it easier\n\nimport {\n\tLoggerProxy as Logger\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\n// Info-level logging of a trigger function, with workflow name and workflow ID as additional metadata properties\n\nLogger.info(`Polling trigger initiated for workflow \"${workflow.name}\"`, {workflowName: workflow.name, workflowId: workflow.id});\n```\n\nWhen creating new loggers, some useful standards to keep in mind are:\n\n- Craft log messages to be as human-readable as possible. For example, always wrap names in quotes.\n- Duplicating information in the log message and metadata, like workflow name in the above example, can be useful as messages are easier to search and metadata enables easier filtering.\n- Include multiple IDs (for example, `executionId`, `workflowId`, and `sessionId`) throughout all logs.\n- Use node types instead of node names (or both) as this is more consistent, and so easier to search.\n\n## Front-end logs\n\nAs of now, front-end logs aren't available. Using `Logger` or `LoggerProxy` would yield errors in the `editor-ui` package. This functionality will get implemented in the future versions.",

Read [Cloud concurrency](/manage-cloud/concurrency/) to learn how concurrency works with n8n Cloud accounts.\n///\n\nIn regular mode, n8n doesn't limit how many production executions may run at the same time. This can lead to a scenario where too many concurrent executions thrash the event loop, causing performance degradation and unresponsiveness. \n\nTo prevent this, you can set a concurrency limit for production executions in regular mode. Use this to control how many production executions run concurrently, and queue up any concurrent production executions over the limit. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order.\n\nConcurrency control is disabled by default. To enable it:\n\n```sh\nexport N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT=20\n```\n\nKeep in mind:\n\n- Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, error executions, or started from CLI.\n- You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.\n- On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.\n<!-- vale off -->\n- To monitor concurrency control, watch logs for executions being added to the queue and released. In a future version, n8n will show concurrency control in the UI.\n<!-- vale on -->\n\nWhen you enable concurrency control, you can view the number of active executions and the configured limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab.\n\n## Comparison to queue mode\n\nIn queue mode, you can control how many jobs a worker may run concurrently using the [`--concurrency` flag](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/#configure-worker-concurrency).\n\nConcurrency control in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency control in regular mode, but the environment variable `N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT` controls both of them. In queue mode, n8n takes the limit from this variable if set to a value other than `-1`, falling back to the `--concurrency` flag or its default.",

If you don't set `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE`, 336 hours (14 days) is the default.\n\nYou can choose to prune finished executions data before the time set in `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE`, using `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT`. This sets a maximum number of executions to store in the database. Once you reach the limit, n8n starts to delete the oldest execution records. This can help with database performance issues, especially if you use SQLite. The database size can still exceed the limit you set: old executions that haven't finished running don't get deleted, even if they would otherwise be subject to deletion.\n\n```sh\n# npm\n# Activate automatic data pruning\nexport EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true\n\n# Number of hours after execution that n8n deletes data\nexport EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168\n\n# Number of executions to store\nexport EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000\n```\n\n```sh\n# Docker\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n --name n8n \\\n -p 5678:5678 \\\n -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true \\\n -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168 \\\n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n\n```\n\n```yaml\n# Docker Compose\nn8n:\n    environment:\n      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true\n      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168\n\t  \t- EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000\n```\n\n/// note | SQLite\nIf you run n8n using the default SQLite database, the disk space of any pruned data isn't automatically freed up but rather reused for future executions data.

This feature is useful to avoid relying on the filesystem for storing large amounts of binary data. \n\nn8n will introduce external storage for other data types in the future.\n\n## Storing n8n's binary data in S3\n\nn8n supports [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html){:target=_blank .external-link} as an external store for binary data produced by workflow executions. You can use other S3-compatible services like Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze B2, but n8n doesn't officially support these.\n\n/// info | Enterprise-tier feature\nYou will need an [Enterprise license key](/enterprise-key/) for external storage. If your license key expires and you remain on S3 mode, the instance will be able to read from, but not write to, the S3 bucket.\n///\n### Setup\n\nCreate and configure a bucket following the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html){:target=_blank .external-link}. You can use the following policy, replacing `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket you created:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n\t\"Statement\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"Sid\": \"VisualEditor0\",\n\t\t\t\"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n\t\t\t\"Action\": [\"s3:*\"],\n\t\t\t\"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>\", \"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*\"]\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\nSet a bucket-level lifecycle configuration so that S3 automatically deletes old binary data. n8n delegates pruning of binary data to S3, so setting a lifecycle configuration is required unless you want to preserve binary data indefinitely.\n\nOnce you finish creating the bucket, you will have a host, bucket name and region, and an access key ID and secret access key. You need to set them in n8n's environment:\n\n```sh\nexport N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_HOST=... # example: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\nexport N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=...\nexport N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION=...\nexport N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=...\nexport N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_SECRET=...\n```\n\n/// note | No region\nIf your provider doesn't require a region, you can set `N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION` to `'auto'`. \n///\nTell n8n to store binary data in S3:\n\n```sh\nexport N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES=filesystem,s3\nexport N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=s3\n```\n\nRestart the server to load the new configuration.\n\n### Usage\n\nAfter you enable S3, n8n writes and reads any new binary data to and from the S3 bucket. n8n writes binary data to your S3 bucket in this format:\n\n```\nworkflows/{workflowId}/executions/{executionId}/binary_data/{binaryFileId}\n```\n\nn8n continues to read older binary data stored in the filesystem from the filesystem, if `filesystem` remains listed as an option in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES`.\n\nIf you store binary data in S3 and later switch to filesystem mode, the instance continues to read any data stored in S3, as long as `s3` remains listed in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES` and your S3 credentials remain valid.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/scaling/binary-data-pruning.md\"",

While this gives you freedom, it can lead to errors when workflow executions require more memory than available. This page explains how to identify and avoid these errors.\n\n/// note | Only for self-hosted n8n\nThis page describes memory-related errors when [self-hosting n8n](/hosting/). Visit [Cloud data management](/manage-cloud/cloud-data-management/) to learn about memory limits for [n8n Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview/).\n///\n\n## Identifying out of memory situations\n\nn8n provides error messages that warn you in some out of memory situations. For example, messages such as **Execution stopped at this node (n8n may have run out of memory while executing it)**.\n\nError messages including **Problem running workflow**, **Connection Lost**, or **503 Service Temporarily Unavailable** suggest that an n8n instance has become unavailable. \n\nWhen self-hosting n8n, you may also see error messages such as **Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory** in your server logs. \n\nOn n8n Cloud, or when using n8n's Docker image, n8n restarts automatically when encountering such an issue. However, when running n8n with npm you might need to restart it manually.\n\n## Typical causes\n\nSuch problems occur when a workflow execution requires more memory than available to an n8n instance. Factors increasing the memory usage for a workflow execution include:\n\n- Amount of [JSON data](/data/data-structure/).\n- Size of binary data.\n- Number of nodes in a workflow.\n- Some nodes are memory-heavy: the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node and the older Function node can increase memory consumption significantly.\n- Manual or automatic workflow executions: manual executions increase memory consumption as n8n makes a copy of the data for the frontend.\n- Additional workflows running at the same time.\n\n## Avoiding out of memory situations\n\nWhen encountering an out of memory situation, there are two options: either increase the amount of memory available to n8n or reduce the memory consumption.\n\n### Increase available memory\n\nWhen self-hosting n8n, increasing the amount of memory available to n8n means provisioning your n8n instance with more memory. This may incur additional costs with your hosting provider.\n\nOn n8n cloud you need to upgrade to a larger plan.\n\n### Reduce memory consumption\n\nThis approach is more complex and means re-building the workflows causing the issue. This section provides some guidelines on how to reduce memory consumption. Not all suggestions are applicable to all workflows.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/scaling/reduce-memory-consumption.md\"\n\n### Increase old memory\n\nThis applies to self-hosting n8n. When encountering **JavaScript heap out of memory** errors, it's often useful to allocate additional memory to the old memory section of the V8 JavaScript engine. To do this, set the appropriate [V8 option](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-old-space-sizesize-in-megabytes){:target=_blank .external-link} `--max-old-space-size=SIZE` either through the CLI or through the `NODE_OPTIONS` [environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_optionsoptions){:target=_blank .external-link}.",

    "rate-limits.md": "---\n#https://www.notion.so/n8n/Frontmatter-432c2b8dff1f43d4b1c8d20075510fe4\ntitle: Handling API rate limits\npageType: howto\ndescription: How to handle API rate limits when using n8n integrations.\n---\n\n# Handling API rate limits\n\nAPI rate limits are restrictions on request frequency. For example, an API may limit the number of requests you can make per minute, or per day.\n\nAPIs can also limits how much data you can send in one request, or how much data the API sends in a single response.\n\n## Identify rate limit issues\n\nWhen an n8n node hits a rate limit, it errors. n8n displays the error message in the node output panel. This includes the error message from the service.\n\nIf n8n received error 429 (too many requests) from the service, the error message is **The service is receiving too many requests from you**.\n\nTo check the rate limits for the service you're using, refer to the API documentation for the service.\n\n## Handle rate limits for integrations\n\nThere are two ways to handle rate limits in n8n's integrations: using the Retry On Fail setting, or using a combination of the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) and [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) nodes: \n\n* Retry On Fail adds a pause between API request attempts.\n* With Loop Over Items and Wait you can break you request data into smaller chunks, as well as pausing between requests.\n\n### Enable Retry On Fail\n\nWhen you enable Retry On Fail, the node automatically tries the request again if it fails the first time.\n\n1. Open the node.\n1. Select **Settings**.\n1. Enable the **Retry On Fail** toggle.\n1. Configure the retry settings: if using this to work around rate limits, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to more than the rate limit. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.\n\n### Use Loop Over Items and Wait\n\nUse the Loop Over Items node to batch the input items, and the Wait node to introduce a pause between each request.\n\n1. Add the Loop Over Items node before the node that calls the API. Refer to [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) for information on how to configure the node.\n1. Add the Wait node after the node that calls the API, and connect it back to the Loop Over Items node. Refer to [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) for information on how to configure the node.\n\nFor example, to handle rate limits when using OpenAI:\n\n![\"Screenshot of a workflow using the Loop Over Items node and Wait node to handle API rate limits for the OpenAI APIs\"](/_images/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/loop-wait.png)\n\n## Handle rate limits in the HTTP Request node\n\nThe HTTP Request node has built-in settings for handling rate limits and large amounts of data.\n\n### Batch requests\n\nUse the Batching option to send more than one request, reducing the request size, and introducing a pause between requests. This is the equivalent of using Loop Over Items and Wait.\n\n1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Batching**.\n1. Set **Items per Batch**: this is the number of input items to include in each request.\n1. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.\n\n### Paginate results\n\nAPIs paginate their results when they need to send more data than they can handle in a single response. For more information on pagination in the HTTP Request node, refer to [HTTP Request node | Pagination](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/#pagination).",

Note that the API always has a limit of 30,000 returned records, whatever value you provide.\n* In the **Query Options** section, you can activate the following parameters:\n    * **Query** lets you specify filter predicates in MongoDB's JSON query format. For example: `{\"status\": \"success\", \"_submission_time\": {\"$lt\": \"2021-11-01T01:02:03\"}}` queries for all submissions with the value `success` for the field `status`, and submitted before November 1st, 2021, 01:02:03.\n    * **Fields** lets you specify the list of fields you want to fetch, to make the response lighter.\n    * **Sort** lets you provide a list of sorting criteria in MongoDB JSON format. For example, `{\"status\": 1, \"_submission_time\": -1}` specifies a sort order by ascending status, and then descending submission time.\n\nMore details about these options can be found in the [Formhub API docs](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Formhub-Access-Points-(API)#api-parameters)\n\n### Submission options\n\nAll operations that return form submission data offer options to tweak the response. These include:\n\n- Download options lets you download any attachment linked to each particular form submissions, such as pictures and videos. It also lets you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images). \n- Formatting options perform some reformatting as described in [About reformatting](#about-reformatting).\n\n#### About reformatting\n\nThe default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings.\n\nThis node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the **Reformat?** parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations.\n\nWhen enabled, the reformatting:\n\n- Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a `/` character in the field names, for example `Group1/Question1`. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into `Group1.Question1`, as nested JSON objects.\n- Renames fields to trim `_` (not supported by many downstream systems).\n- Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent.\n- Splits all fields matching any of the **Multiselect Mask** wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the `*` wildcard.\n- Converts all fields matching any of the **Number Mask** wildcard masks into a JSON float.\n\nHere's a detailed example in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_id\": 471987,\n  \"formhub/uuid\": \"189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6\",\n  \"start\": \"2021-12-05T16:13:38.527+02:00\",\n  \"end\": \"2021-12-05T16:15:33.407+02:00\",\n  \"Field_Details/Field_Name\": \"Test Fields\",\n  \"Field_Details/Field_Location\": \"-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165\",\n  \"Field_Details/Field_Shape\": \"-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165;-1.933011 30.078085 0 0;-1.933257 30.078004 0 0;-1.933338 30.078197 0 0;-1.933107 30.078299 0 0;-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165\",\n  \"Field_Details/Crops_Grown\": \"maize beans avocado\",\n  \"Field_Details/Field_Size_sqm\": \"2300\",\n  \"__version__\": \"veGcULpqP6JNFKRJbbMvMs\",\n  \"meta/instanceID\": \"uuid:2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\",\n  \"_xform_id_string\": \"ajXVJpBkTD5tB4Nu9QXpgm\",\n  \"_uuid\": \"2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\",\n  \"_attachments\": [],\n  \"_status\": \"submitted_via_web\",\n  \"_geolocation\": [\n    -1.932914,\n    30.078211\n  ],\n  \"_submission_time\": \"2021-12-05T14:15:44\",\n  \"_tags\": [],\n  \"_notes\": [],\n  \"_validation_status\": {},\n  \"_submitted_by\": null\n}\n```\n\nWith reformatting enabled, and the appropriate masks for multi-select and number formatting (for example, `Crops_*` and `*_sqm` respectively), n8n parses it into:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": 471987,\n  \"formhub\": {\n    \"uuid\": \"189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6\"\n  },\n  \"start\": \"2021-12-05T16:13:38.527+02:00\",\n  \"end\": \"2021-12-05T16:15:33.407+02:00\",\n  \"Field_Details\": {\n    \"Field_Name\": \"Test Fields\",\n    \"Field_Location\": {\n      \"lat\": -1.932914,\n      \"lon\": 30.078211\n    },\n    \"Field_Shape\": {\n      \"type\": \"polygon\",\n      \"coordinates\": [\n        {\n          \"lat\": -1.932914,\n          \"lon\": 30.078211\n        },\n        {\n          \"lat\": -1.933011,\n          \"lon\": 30.078085\n        },\n        {\n          \"lat\": -1.933257,\n          \"lon\": 30.078004\n        },\n        {\n          \"lat\": -1.933338,\n          \"lon\": 30.078197\n        },\n        {\n          \"lat\": -1.933107,\n          \"lon\": 30.078299\n        },\n        {\n          \"lat\": -1.932914,\n          \"lon\": 30.078211\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"Crops_Grown\": [\n      \"maize\",\n      \"beans\",\n      \"avocado\"\n    ],\n    \"Field_Size_sqm\": 2300\n  },\n  \"version\": \"veGcULpqP6JNFKRJbbMvMs\",\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"instanceID\": \"uuid:2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\"\n  },\n  \"xform_id_string\": \"ajXVJpBkTD5tB4Nu9QXpgm\",\n  \"uuid\": \"2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\",\n  \"attachments\": [],\n  \"status\": \"submitted_via_web\",\n  \"geolocation\": {\n    \"lat\": -1.932914,\n    \"lon\": 30.078211\n  },\n  \"submission_time\": \"2021-12-05T14:15:44\",\n  \"tags\": [],\n  \"notes\": [],\n  \"validation_status\": {},\n  \"submitted_by\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/operation-not-supported.md\"",

Use this to limit the length of the output. \n- **Number of Completions**: Defaults to 1. Set the number of completions you want to generate for each prompt. Use carefully since setting a high number will quickly consume your tokens. \n- **Presence Penalty**: Apply a penalty to influence the model to discuss new topics. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.\n- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around `0.7`) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they\u2019re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it.

Follow technical documentation to integrate Sentiment Analysis node into your workflows.\ncontentType: integration\n---\n\n# Sentiment Analysis node\n\nUse the Sentiment Analysis node to analyze the sentiment of incoming text data.\n\nThe language model uses the [**Sentiment Categories**](#node-options) in the node options to determine each item's sentiment.\n\n## Node parameters\n\n* **Text to Analyze** defines the input text for sentiment analysis. This is an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be \n`{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is from a chat or message source. By default, it expects a `text` field.\n\n## Node options\n\n* **Sentiment Categories**: Define the categories that you want to classify your input as.\n    * By default, these are `Positive, Neutral, Negative`. You can customize these categories to fit your specific use case, such as `Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative` for more granular analysis.\n* **Include Detailed Results**: When turned on, this option includes sentiment strength and confidence scores in the output. Note that these scores are estimates generated by the language model and are rough indicators rather than precise measurements.\n* **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the sentiment analysis. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.\n* **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.\n\n## Usage Notes\n\n### Model Temperature Setting\n\nIt's strongly advised to set the temperature of the connected language model to 0 or a value close to 0. This helps ensure that the results are as deterministic as possible, providing more consistent and reliable sentiment analysis across multiple runs.\n\n### Language Considerations\n\nThe node's performance may vary depending on the language of the input text.\n\nFor best results, ensure your chosen language model supports the input language.\n\n### Processing Large Volumes\n\nWhen analyzing large amounts of text, consider splitting the input into smaller chunks to optimize processing time and resource usage.\n\n### Iterative Refinement\n\nFor complex sentiment analysis tasks, you may need to iteratively refine the system prompt and categories to achieve the desired results.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Basic Sentiment Analysis\n\n1. Connect a data source (for example, RSS Feed, HTTP Request) to the Sentiment Analysis node.\n2. Set the \"Text to Analyze\" field to the relevant item property (for example, `{{ $json.content }}` for blog post content).\n3. Keep the default sentiment categories.\n4. Connect the node's outputs to separate paths for processing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments differently.\n\n### Custom Category Analysis\n\n1. Change the **Sentiment Categories** to `Excited, Happy, Neutral, Disappointed, Angry`.\n2. Adjust your workflow to handle these five output categories.\n3. Use this setup to analyze customer feedback with more nuanced emotional categories.\n\n## Related resources\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-overview-link.md\"\n--8<-- \"_glossary/ai-glossary.md\"",

Choose from:\n\t* **All fields**: The output includes data from all fields with no further parameters.\n\t* **Specified Fields**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should include data from in the **Fields To Include** parameter. The output will include only the fields in this list.\n\t* **All Fields Except**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should exclude data from in the **Fields To Exclude** parameter. The output will include all fields not in this list.\n\nRefer to [Node options](#node-options) for more configuration options.\n\n## Node options\n\nYou can further configure this node using these **Options**:\n\n* **Disable Dot Notation**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. It controls whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on), or allow it (turned off, default).\n* **Merge Lists**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate.

Includes guidance on usage, and links to examples.\ncontentType: integration\npriority: high\n---\n\n# Compare Datasets\n\nThe Compare Datasets node helps you compare data from two input streams.\n\n## Node parameters\n\n1. Decide which fields to compare. In **Input A Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In **Input B Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B. \n2. **Optional**: You can compare by multiple fields. Select **Add Fields to Match** to set up more comparisons.\n3. Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In **When There Are Differences**, select one of the following:\n\t* **Use Input A Version** to treat input stream A as the source of truth.\n\t* **Use Input B Version** to treat input stream B as the source of truth.\n\t* **Use a Mix of Versions** to use different inputs for different fields.\n\t\t* Use **Prefer** to select either **Input A Version** or **Input B Version** as the main source of truth.\n\t\t* Enter input fields that are exceptions to **For Everything Except** to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.\n\t* **Include Both Versions** to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.\n4. Decide whether to use **Fuzzy Compare**. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string `3` are treated as the same with **Fuzzy Compare** turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.\n\n## Understand item comparison\n\nItem comparison is a two stage process:\n\n1. n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.\n2. If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.\n\n## Node options\n\nUse the node **Options** to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.\n\n### Fields to Skip Comparing\n\nEnter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.\n\nFor example, if you compare the two datasets below using `person.language` as the **Fields to Match**, n8n returns them as different. If you add `person.name` to **Fields to Skip Comparing**, n8n returns them as matching.\n\n```json\n\t// Input 1\n\t[\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"person\":\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Stefan\",\n\t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"de\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"person\":\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Jim\",\n\t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"en\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"person\":\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Hans\",\n\t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"de\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n\t// Input 2\n\t\t[\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"person\":\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Sara\",\n\t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"de\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"person\":\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Jane\",\n\t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"en\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"person\":\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Harriet\",\n\t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"de\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n```\n\n### Disable Dot Notation\n\nWhether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on) or allow it (turned off, default).\n\n### Multiple Matches\n\nChoose how to handle duplicate data. The default is **Include All Matches**. You can choose **Include First Match Only**.\n\nFor example, given these two datasets:\n```json\n\t// Input 1\n\t[\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"fruit\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"apple\",\n\t\t\t\t\"color\": \"red\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"fruit\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"apple\",\n\t\t\t\t\"color\": \"red\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"fruit\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"banana\",\n\t\t\t\t\"color\": \"yellow\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n\t// Input 2\n\t[\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"fruit\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"apple\",\n\t\t\t\t\"color\": \"red\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"fruit\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"apple\",\n\t\t\t\t\"color\": \"red\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"fruit\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"banana\",\n\t\t\t\t\"color\": \"yellow\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n```\n\nn8n returns three items in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches.\n\nIf you select **Include First Match Only**, n8n returns two items, in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches, but n8n only returns the first occurrence of the matching \"apple\" items.\n\n\n## Understand the output\n\nThere are four output options:\n\n* **In A only Branch**: Contains data that occurs only in the first input.\n* **Same Branch**: Contains data that's the same in both inputs.\n* **Different Branch**: Contains data that's different between inputs.\n* **In B only Branch**: Contains data that occurs only in the second output.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'compare-datasets') ]]",

Includes guidance on usage and links to examples.\ncontentType: integration\n---\n\n# n8n Form node\n\nUse the n8n Form node to create user-facing forms with multiple steps. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. You must start the workflow with the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/).\n\n[[ workflowDemo(\"file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json\") ]]\n\n## Setting up the node\n\n### Set default selections with query parameters\n\nYou can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms){:target=_blank .external-link} with the initial URL provided by the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). Every page in the form receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.\n\n/// note | Only for production\nQuery parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.\n///\n\n<!-- vale from-microsoft.Percentages = NO -->\nWhen using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding){:target=_blank .external-link} any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.\n\nAs an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:\n\n* Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`\n* Fields:\n\t* `name`: `Jane Doe`\n\t* `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`\n\nWith query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:\n\n```\nhttps://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe\n```\n\nHere, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character (` `) with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.\n<!-- vale from-microsoft.Percentages = YES -->\n\n### Defining the form using JSON\n\nUse **Define Form** > **Using JSON** to define the fields of your form with a [JSON array of objects](/data/data-structure). Each object defines a single field by using a combination of these keys:\n\n- `fieldLabel`: The label that appears above the input field. \n- `fieldType`: Choose from `date`, `dropdown`, `email`, `file`, `number`, `password`, `text`, or `textarea`.\n    - Use `date` to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.\n\t- When using `dropdown`, set the choices with `fieldOptions` (reference the example below). By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, set `multiselect` to `true`.\n\t- When using `file`, set `multipleFiles` to `true` to allow users to select more than one file. To define the file types to allow, set `acceptFileTypes` to a string containing a comma-separated list of file extensions (reference the example below).\n- `placeholder`: Specify placeholder data for the field. You can use this for every `fieldType` except `dropdown`, `date`, and `file`.\n- `requiredField`: Require users to complete this field on the form.\n\nAn example JSON that shows the general format required and the keys available:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the \"requiredField\" key on any field to mark it as mandatory\n// Use the \"placeholder\" key to specify placeholder data for all fields\n//     except 'dropdown', 'date' and 'file'\n\n[\n\t{\n\t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Date Field\",\n\t\t\"fieldType\": \"date\",\n\t\t\"formatDate\": \"mm/dd/yyyy\", // how to format received date in n8n\n\t\t\"requiredField\": true\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Dropdown Options\",\n\t\t\"fieldType\": \"dropdown\",\n\t\t\"fieldOptions\": {\n\t\t\t\"values\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"option\": \"option 1\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"option\": \"option 2\"\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"requiredField\": true\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Multiselect\",\n\t\t\"fieldType\": \"dropdown\",\n\t\t\"fieldOptions\": {\n\t\t\t\"values\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"option\": \"option 1\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"option\": \"option 2\"\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"multiselect\": true // setting to true allows multi-select\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Email\",\n\t\t\"fieldType\": \"email\",\n\t\t\"placeholder\": \"me@mail.con\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"File\",\n\t\t\"fieldType\": \"file\",\n\t\t\"multipleFiles\": true, // setting to true allows multiple files selection\n\t\t\"acceptFileTypes\": \".jpg, .png\" // allowed file types\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Number\",\n\t\t\"fieldType\": \"number\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Password\",\n\t\t\"fieldType\": \"password\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t// \"fieldType\": \"text\" can be omitted since it's the default type\n\t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Text\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Textarea\",\n\t\t\"fieldType\": \"textarea\"\n\t}\n]\n```\n\n### Form Ending\n\nUse the **Form Ending** Page Type to end a form and either show a completion page or redirect the user to a URL. Only one Form Ending page is displayed per execution, even when n8n executes [multiple branches](#forms-with-branches) that contain Form Ending nodes.\n\nChoose between these options when using **On n8n Form Submission**:\n\n- **Show Completion Screen**: Shows users a final screen to confirm that they submitted the form.\n\t- Fill in **Completion Title** to set the `h1` title on the form.\n\t- n8n displays the **Completion Message** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\\n` or `<br>` to add a line break. \n\t- Select **Add option** and fill in **Completion Page Title** to set the page's title in the browser tab.\n\nWhen using **Redirect to URL**, fill in the **URL** field with the page you want to redirect to when users complete the form.\n\n### Forms with branches\n\nThe n8n Form node executes and displays its associated form page whenever it receives data from a previous node. When building forms with n8n, to avoid confusion, it's important to understand how forms behave when branching occurs.\n\n#### Workflows with mutually exclusive branches\n\nForm workflows containing mutually exclusive branches work as expected. n8n will execute a single branch according to the submitted data and conditions you outline. As it executes, n8n will display each page in the branch, ending with an n8n Form node with the **Form Ending** page type.\n\nThis workflow demonstrates mutually exclusive branching. Each selection can only execute a single branch.\n\n[[ workflowDemo(\"file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json\") ]]\n\n#### Workflows that may execute multiple branches\n\nForm workflows that send data to multiple branches at the same time require more care. When multiple branches receive data during an execution (for example, from a [switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) node), n8n executes each branch that receives data [sequentially](/flow-logic/execution-order/). Upon reaching the end of one branch, the execution will move to the next branch with data.\n\nn8n only executes a single **Form Ending** n8n Form node for each execution. When multiple branches of a form workflow receive data, n8n ignores all Form Ending nodes except for the one associated with the final branch.\n\nThis workflow may execute more than one branch during an execution. Here, n8n executes all valid branches sequentially. This impacts which n8n Form nodes n8n executes (in particular, which **Form Ending** node displays):\n\n[[ workflowDemo(\"file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/multiple-branch-execution.json\") ]]\n\n### Node options\n\nSelect **Add Option** to view more configuration options: \n\n- **Form Title**: The title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.\n- **Form Description**: The description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\\n` or `<br>` to add a line break. \n- **Button Label**: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the **Button Label** as the name of the submit button.\n\n## Running the node\n\n### Build and test workflows\n\nWhile building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL** in the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. \n\nThere are two ways to test:\n\n- Select **Test Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node and any previous nodes, but not the rest of the workflow.\n- Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.\n\n### Production workflows\n\nWhen your workflow is ready, switch to using the n8n Form Trigger's **Production URL** by opening the trigger node and selecting the **Production URL** in the **From URLS** selector. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.\n\nWhen working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'n8n-form') ]]",

Similar to a pivot table.\n\n### Split Out Items\n\nThis operation is useful if your data contains a list of items, for example a list of customers, and you want to split them so that you have an item for each customer.\n\nWhen using the Split Out Items operation, configure the following parameters and options:\n\n* **Field to Split Out**: the field containing the list you want to separate out into individual items.\n\t* If working with file inputs, use `$binary` in an expression to set the field to split out.\n* **Include**: select if  you want n8n to keep any other fields from the input data with each new individual item. You can select:\n    * **No Other Fields**\n    * **All Other Fields**\n    * **Selected Other Fields**: when selected, n8n displays **Fields to Include**. Enter a comma separated list of desired fields.\n\t* **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:\n\t\t* **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).\t\n\t\t* **Destination Field Name**: optionally set the field name under which to put the new split contents.\n\t\t* **Include Binary**: include binary data (files) from the input in the new output.\n\n### Concatenate Items\n\nThe Concatenate Items operations is useful when you want to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.\n\nWhen using the Concatenate Items operation, configure the following parameters and options:\n\n* **Aggregate**: choose whether to aggregate **Individual Fields** or **All Item Data**.\n* If you choose **Individual Fields**, you can then set:\n\t* **Field To Aggregate**: the name of the field in the input data to be aggregated together.\n\t* **Rename Field**: enable this toggle to enter a field name for the aggregated output data. When aggregating multiple fields you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.\n\t* **Output Field Name**: displayed when you enable **Rename Field**. The field name for the aggregated output data.\n\t* **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:\n\t\t* **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).\n\t\t* **Include Binaries**: include binary data (files) from the input in the new output.\n* If you choose **All Item Data**, you can then set:\n\t* **Put Output in Field**: the name of the output field.\n\t* **Include**: choose from **All fields**, **Specified Fields**, or **All Fields Except**.\n\n\n### Remove Duplicates\n\nThere are situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items. \n\nThe Remove Duplicates operation allows you to identify those items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.\n\nWhen using the Remove Duplicates operation, configure the following parameters and options:\n\n* **Compare**: specify which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:\n  * **All Fields**: compares all fields of the input data.\n  * **All Fields Except**: enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.\n  * **Selected Fields**: enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.\n* If you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields**, n8n displays **Options** > **Add Field**. Use this to add more optional settings, including:\n\t* **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).\n\n### Sort\n\nThe Sort operation allows you to organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.\n\n/// note | Array sort behavior\nThe Sort operation uses the default JavaScript operation where the elements to be sorted are converted into strings and their values compared.

The final data source combines these data sources by all possible combinations.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/multiplex-diagram.png)\n<figcaption>Combine by All Possible Combinations mode inputs and output</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n#### Combine mode options\n\nWhen merging data by **Mode > Combine**, you can set these **Options**:\n\n* **Clash Handling**: Choose how to merge when data streams clash, or when there are sub-fields. Refer to [Clash handling](#clash-handling) for details.\n* **Fuzzy Compare**: Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats `\"3\"` and `3` as the same.\n* **Disable Dot Notation**: This prevents accessing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name.\n* **Multiple Matches**: Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams.\n    * **Include All Matches**: Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match.\n    * **Include First Match Only**: Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches.\n* **Include Any Unpaired Items**: Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match. \n\n##### Clash Handling\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/field-value-clash.md\"\n\n### SQL Query\n\nWrite a custom SQL Query to merge the data. \n\nExample: \n```sql\nSELECT * FROM input1 LEFT JOIN input2 ON input1.name = input2.id\n```\n\nData from previous nodes are available as tables and you can use them in the SQL query as input1, input2, input3, and so on, based on their order. Refer to [AlaSQL GitHub page](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Supported-SQL-statements){:target=_blank .external-link} for a full list of supported SQL statements. \n\n### Choose Branch\n\nChoose which input to keep. This option always waits until the data from both inputs is available. You can choose to **Output**:\n\n* The **Input 1 Data**\n* The **Input 2 Data**\n* **A Single, Empty Item**\n\nThe node outputs the data from the chosen input, without changing it.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'merge') ]]\n\n## Merging data streams with uneven numbers of items\n\nThe items passed into Input 1 of the Merge node will take precedence. For example, if the Merge node receives five items in Input 1 and 10 items in Input 2, it only processes five items. The remaining five items from Input 2 aren't processed.\n\n## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/if-merge-branch-execution.md\"\n\n\n## Try it out: A step by step example\n\nCreate a workflow with some example input data to try out the Merge node.\n\n### Set up sample data using the Code nodes\n\n1. Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Start node.\n2. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:\n```js\nreturn [\n  {\n    json: {\n      name: 'Stefan',\n      language: 'de',\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    json: {\n      name: 'Jim',\n      language: 'en',\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    json: {\n      name: 'Hans',\n      language: 'de',\n    }\n  }\n];\n```\n3. Add a second Code node, and connect it to the Start node.\n4. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:\n```js\nreturn [\n\t  {\n    json: {\n      greeting: 'Hello',\n      language: 'en',\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    json: {\n      greeting: 'Hallo',\n      language: 'de',\n    }\n  }\n];\n```\n\n### Try out different merge modes\n\nAdd the Merge node. Connect the first Code node to **Input 1**, and the second Code node to **Input 2**. Run the workflow to load data into the Merge node.\n\nThe final workflow should look like this:\n\n[[ workflowDemo(\"https://api.n8n.io/workflows/templates/655\") ]]\n\nNow try different options in **Mode** to see how it affects the output data.\n\n#### Append\n\nSelect **Mode** > **Append**, then select **Test step**.\n\nYour output in table view should look like this:\n<!-- vale off -->\n| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stefan | de |  |\n| Jim | en |  |\n| Hans | de |  |\n|   | en | Hello |\n|   | de | Hallo |\n<!-- vale on -->\n\n#### Combine by Matching Fields\n\nYou can merge these two data inputs so that each person gets the correct greeting for their language.\n\n1. Select **Mode** > **Combine**.\n2. Select **Combine by** > **Matching Fields**.\n3. In both **Input 1 Field** and **Input 2 Field**, enter `language`. This tells n8n to combine the data by matching the values in the `language` field in each data set.\n4. Select **Test step**.\n\nYour output in table view should look like this:\n<!-- vale off -->\n\n| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stefan | de | Hallo |\n| Jim | en | Hello  |\n| Hans | de | Hallo |\n<!-- vale on -->\n\n#### Combine by Position\n\nSelect **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **Position**, then select **Test step**.\n\nYour output in table view should look like this:\n<!-- vale off -->\n| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stefan | en | Hello |\n| Jim | de | Hallo  |\n<!-- vale on -->\n\n##### Keep unpaired items\n\nIf you want to keep all items, select **Add Option** > **Include Any Unpaired Items**, then turn on **Include Any Unpaired Items**.\n\nYour output in table view should look like this:\n<!-- vale off -->\n| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stefan | en | Hello |\n| Jim | de | Hallo  |\n| Hans | de |  |\n<!-- vale on -->\n\n#### Combine by All Possible Combinations \n\nSelect **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **All Possible Combinations**, then select **Test step**.\n\nYour output in table view should look like this:\n<!-- vale off -->\n| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stefan | en | Hello |\n| Stefan | de | Hallo |\n| Jim | en | Hello  |\n| Jim | de | Hallo |\n| Hans | en | Hello |\n| Hans | de | Hallo |\n<!-- vale on -->",

Includes guidance on usage, and links to examples.\ncontentType: integration\npriority: critical\n---\n\n# Edit Fields (Set)\n\nUse the Edit Fields node to set workflow data. This node can set new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values to Google Sheets or databases.\n\n## Node parameters\n\nThe are the settings and options available in the Edit Fields node.\n\n### Mode\n\nYou can either use **Manual Mapping** to edit fields using the GUI or **JSON Output** to write JSON that n8n adds to the input data.\n\n### Fields to Set\n\nIf you select **Mode** > **Manual Mapping**, you can configure the fields by dragging and dropping values from **INPUT**.\n\nThe default behavior when you drag a value is:\n\n* n8n sets the value's name as the field name.\n* The field value contains an expression which accesses the value.\n\nIf you don't want to use expressions:\n\n1. Hover over a field. n8n displays the **Fixed | Expressions** toggle. \n1. Select **Fixed**.\n\nYou can do this for both the name and value of the field.\n\n![A gif showing the drag and drop action, as well as changing a field to fixed](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/set/drag-drop-fixed-toggle.gif)\n\n### Keep Only Set Fields\n\nEnable this to discard any input data that you don't use in **Fields to Set**.\n\n### Include in Output\n\nChoose which input data to include in the node's output data.\n\n## Node options\n\nUse these options to customize the behavior of the node.\n\n### Include Binary Data\n\nIf the input data includes binary data, choose whether to include it in the Edit Fields node's output data.\n\n### Ignore Type Conversion Errors\n\nManual Mapping only.\n\nEnabling this allows n8n to ignore some data type errors when mapping fields.\n\n### Support Dot Notation\n\nBy default, n8n supports dot notation.\n\nFor example, when using manual mapping, the node follows the dot notation for the **Name** field. That means if you set the name in the **Name** field as `number.one` and the value in the **Value** field as `20`, the resulting JSON is:\n\n```json\n{ \"number\": { \"one\": 20} }\n```\n\nYou can prevent this behavior by selecting **Add Option** > **Support Dot Notation**, and setting the **Dot Notion** field to off. Now the resulting JSON is:\n\n```json\n{ \"number.one\": 20 }\n```\n## Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'set') ]]\n\n## Arrays and expressions in JSON Output mode\n\nYou can use arrays and expressions when creating your JSON Output.\n\nFor example, given this input data generated by the Customer Datastore node:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"23423532\",\n    \"name\": \"Jay Gatsby\",\n    \"email\": \"gatsby@west-egg.com\",\n    \"notes\": \"Keeps asking about a green light??\",\n    \"country\": \"US\",\n    \"created\": \"1925-04-10\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"23423533\",\n    \"name\": \"Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda\",\n    \"email\": \"jab@macondo.co\",\n    \"notes\": \"Lots of people named after him.

This allows you to get separate summaries based on values in other fields.\n\nFor example, if our input data contains columns for `Sales Rep` and `Deal Amount` and we're performing a **Sum** on the `Deal Amount` field, we could split by `Sales Rep` to get a **Sum** total for each Sales Rep.\n\nTo enter multiple fields to split by, enter a comma-separated list.\n\n## Node options\n\n### Continue if Field Not Found\n\nBy default, if a **Field to Summarize** isn't in any items, the node throws an error. Use this option to continue and return a single empty item (turned on) instead or keep the default error behavior (turned off).\n\n### Disable Dot Notation\n\nBy default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).\n\n### Output Format\n\nSelect the format for your output format. This option is recommended if you're using **Fields to Split By**\n\n* **Each Split in a Separate Item**: Use this option to generate a separate output item for each split out field.\n* **All Splits in a Single Item**: Use this option to generate a single item that lists the split out fields.\n\n## Ignore items without valid fields to group by\n\nSet whether to ignore input items that don't contain the **Fields to Split By** (turned on) or not (turned off).\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'summarize') ]]\n\n## Related resources\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/data-transformation-actions/data-section-link.md\"",

Includes guidance on usage, and links to examples.\ncontentType: integration\npriority: critical\n---\n\n# Wait\n\nUse the Wait node pause your workflow's execution. When the workflow pauses it offloads the execution data to the database. When the resume condition is met, the workflow reloads the data and the execution continues.\n\n## Operations\n\nThe Wait node can **Resume** on the following conditions:\n\n* [**After Time Interval**](#after-time-interval): The node waits for a certain amount of time.\n* [**At Specified Time**](#at-specified-time): The node waits until a specific time.\n* [**On Webhook Call**](#on-webhook-call): The node waits until it receives an HTTP call.\n* [**On Form Submitted**](#on-form-submitted): The node waits until it receives a form submission.\n\nRefer to the more detailed sections below for more detailed instructions.\n\n### After Time Interval\n\nWait for a certain amount of time.\n\nThis parameter includes two more fields:\n\n* **Wait Amount**: Enter the amount of time to wait.\n* **Wait Unit**: Select the unit of measure for the **Wait Amount**. Choose from:\n\t* **Seconds**\n\t* **Minutes**\n\t* **Hours**\n\t* **Days**\n\nRefer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on how these intervals work and the timezone used.\n\n### At Specified Time\n\nWait until a specific date and time to continue. Use the date and time picker to set the **Date and Time**.\n\nRefer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on the timezone used.\n\n### On Webhook Call\n\nThis parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call.\n\nThe webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the `$execution.resumeUrl` variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email. \n\nWhen the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the `$execution.resumeUrl`. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.\n\nFor this **Resume** style, set more parameters listed below.\n\n#### Authentication\n\nSelect if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to `$execution.resumeUrl` should be authenticated. Options include:\n\n* **Basic Auth**: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Basic Auth** to use.\n* **Header Auth**: Use header authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Header Auth** to use.\n* **JWT Auth**: Use JWT authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for JWT Auth** to use.\n* **None**: Don't use authentication.\n\n/// note | Auth reference\nRefer to the [Webhook node | Authentication documentation](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#authentication) for more information on each auth type.\n///\n\n#### HTTP Method\n\nSelect the HTTP method the webhook should use. Refer to the [Webhook node | HTTP Method documentation](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#http-method) for more information.\n\n#### Response Code\n\nEnter the Response Code the webhook should return. You can use common codes or enter a custom code.\n\n#### Respond\n\nSet when and how to respond to the webhook from these options:\n\n* **Immediately**: Respond as soon as the node executes.\n* **When Last Node Finishes**: Return the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. If you select this option, also set:\n\t* **Response Data**: Select what data should be returned and what format to use. Options include:\n\t\t* **All Entries**: Returns all the entries of the last node in an array.\n\t\t* **First Entry JSON**: Return the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.\n\t\t* **First Entry Binary**: Return the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.\n\t\t* **No Response Body**: Return with no body.\n* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.\n\n#### Limit Wait Time\n\nSet whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off). If turned on, also set:\n\n* **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:\n\t* **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.\n\t\t* Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.\n\t\t* Select the limit's **Unit** of time.\n\t* **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.\n\t\t* **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.\n\n#### On Webhook Call options\n\n* **Binary Property**: Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. This option's only relevant if binary data is received.\n* **Ignore Bots**: Set whether to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers (turned on) or not (turned off).\n* **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enter IP addresses here to limit who (or what) can invoke the webhook URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook URL.\n* **No Response Body**: Set whether n8n should send a body in the response (turned off) or prevent n8n from sending a body in the response (turned on).\n* **Raw Body**: Set whether to return the body in a raw format like JSON or XML (turned on) or not (turned off).\n* **Response Data**: Enter any custom data you want to send in the response.\n* **Response Headers**: Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header){:target=_blank .external-link} to learn more about response headers.\n* **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.\n\n#### On Webhook Call limitations\n\nThere are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call:\n\n* Partial executions of your workflow changes the `$resumeWebhookUrl`, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node.\n\n### On Form Submitted\n\nWait for a form submission before continuing. Set up these parameters:\n\n#### Form Title\n\nEnter the title to display at the top of the form.\n\n#### Form Description\n\nEnter a form description to display beneath the title. This description can help prompt the user on how to complete the form.\n\n#### Form Fields\n\nSet up each field you want to appear on your form using these parameters:\n\n* **Field Label**: Enter the field label you want to appear in the form.\n* **Field Type**: Select the type of field to display in the form. Choose from:\n\t* **Date**\n\t* **Dropdown List**: Enter each dropdown options in the **Field Options**.\n\t\t* **Multiple Choice**: Select whether the user can select a single dropdown option (turned off) or multiple dropdown options (turned on)\n\t* **Number**\n\t* **Password**\n\t* **Text**\n\t* **Textarea**\n* **Required Field**: Set whether the user must complete this field in order to submit the form (turned on) or if the user can submit the form without completing it (turned off).\n\n#### Respond When\n\nSet when to respond to the form submission. Choose from:\n\n* **Form Is Submitted**: Respond as soon as this node receives the form submission.\n* **Workflow Finishes**: Respond when the last node of this workflow finishes.\n* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond when the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node executes.\n\n#### Limit Wait Time\n\nSet whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off).\n\nIf turned on, also set:\n* **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:\n\t* **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.\n\t\t* Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.\n\t\t* Select the limit's **Unit** of time.\n\t* **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.\n\t\t* **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.\n\n#### On Form Response options\n\n* **Form Response**: Choose how and what you want the form to **Respond With** from these options:\n\t* **Form Submitted Text**: The form displays whatever text is entered in **Text to Show** after a user fills out the form. Use this option if you want to display a confirmation message.\n\t* **Redirect URL**: The form will redirect the user to the **URL to Redirect to** after they fill out the form. This must be a valid URL.\n* **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'wait') ]]\n\n## Time-based operations\n\nFor the time-based resume operations, note that:\n\n* For wait times less than 65 seconds, the workflow doesn't offload execution data to the database. Instead, the process continues to run and the execution resumes after the specified interval passes.\n* The n8n server time is always used regardless of the timezone setting. Workflow timezone settings, and any changes made to them, don't affect the Wait node interval or specified time.",

Select **Listen for test event** to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.\n\nWhen using the Webhook node on localhost on a [self-hosted](/hosting/) n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:\n\n* [npm with tunnel](/hosting/installation/npm/#n8n-with-tunnel)\n* [Docker with tunnel](/hosting/installation/docker/#n8n-with-tunnel)\n\n<video src=\"/_video/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-node-intro.mp4\" controls width=\"100%\"></video>\n\n## Production workflows\n\nWhen your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production** webhook URL. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.\n\nWhen working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.\n\nRefer to [Create a workflow](/workflows/create/) for more information on activating workflows.",

If you're already a paying customer, [contact them](https://actionnetwork.org/contact) to request partner access. Partner access includes API key access.\n2.

If you don't have one already, create an app in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n2. Enter a **Name** for your app.\n3. Select **Create**.\n4. Select **Bot** from the left menu.\n5. Under **Token**, select **Reset Token** to generate a new bot token. \n6.

In **Installation > Installation Contexts**, select the installation contexts you want your bot to use:\n    - Select **Guild Install** for server-installed apps. (Most common for n8n users.)\n    - Select **User Install** for user-installed apps. (Less common for n8n users, but may be useful for testing.)\n    - Refer to Discord's [Choosing installation contexts](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#choosing-installation-contexts){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information about these installation contexts.\n9. In **Installation > Install Link**, select **Discord Provided Link** if it's not already selected.\n10. Still on the **Installation** page, in the **Default Install Settings** section, select `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes. Refer to Discord's [Scopes](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information about these and other scopes.\n11. Add permissions on the **Bot > Bot Permissions** page. Refer to Discord's [Permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information. n8n recommends selecting these permissions for the [Discord](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) node:\n    - Manage Roles\n    - Manage Channels\n    - Read Messages/View Channels\n    - Send Messages\n    - Create Public Threads\n    - Create Private Threads\n    - Send Messages in Threads\n    - Send TTS Messages\n    - Manage Messages\n    - Manage Threads\n    - Embed Links\n    - Attach Files\n    - Read Message History\n    - Add Reactions\n12.

Refer to the [Discord Creating an App](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app){:target=_blank .external-link} guide for more information on creating an app, especially:\n\n- [Fetching your credentials](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#fetching-your-credentials){:target=_blank .external-link} for getting your app's credentials into your local developer environment.\n- [Handling interactivity](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-3-handling-interactivity){:target=_blank .external-link} for information on setting up public endpoints for interactive `/slash` commands.\n\n## Using OAuth2\n\nUse this method if you want to add the bot to Discord servers using the OAuth2 flow, which simplifies the process for those installing your app.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **Client ID**\n- A **Client Secret**\n- Choose whether to send **Authentication** in the **Header** or **Body**\n- A **Bot Token**\n\nFor details on creating an application with a bot and generating the token, follow the same steps as in [Using bot](#using-bot) above.\n\nThen:\n\n1. Copy the **Bot Token** you generate and add it into the n8n credential.\n2. Open the **OAuth2** page in your Discord application to access your **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**. Add these to your n8n credential.\n3. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it into the Discord application in **OAuth2 > Redirects**. Be sure you save these changes.\n\n## Using webhook\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **Webhook URL**: Generated once you create a webhook.\n\nTo get a Webhook URL, you create a webhook and copy the URL that gets generated:\n\n1. Open your Discord **Server Settings** and open the **Integrations** tab.\n2. Select **Create Webhook** to create a new webhook.\n3. Give your webhook a **Name** that makes sense.\n3. Select the **avatar** next to the **Name** to edit or upload a new avatar.\n4. In the **CHANNEL** dropdown, select the channel the webhook should post to.\n5. Select **Copy Webhook URL** to copy the Webhook URL. Enter this URL in your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to the [Discord Making a Webhook documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.\n\n## Choose an authentication method\n\nThe simplest installation is a **webhook**. You create and add webhooks to a single channel on a Discord server. Webhooks can post messages to a channel. They don't require a bot user or authentication. But they can't listen or respond to user requests or commands. If you need a straightforward way to send messages to a channel without the need for interaction or feedback, use a webhook.\n\nA **bot** is an interactive step up from a webhook. You add bots to the Discord server (referred to as a `guild` in the Discord API documentation) or to user accounts. Bots added to the server can interact with users on all the server's channels. They can manage channels, send and retrieve messages, retrieve the list of all users, and change their roles. If you need to build an interactive, complex, or multi-step workflow, use a bot.\n\n**OAuth2** is basically a **bot** that uses an OAuth2 flow rather than just the bot token. As with bots, you add these to the Discord server or to user accounts. These credentials offer the same functionalities as bots, but they can simplify the installation of the bot on your server.",

[Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the Webhooks product.\n2. [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.\n3. [Configure the Facebook trigger](#configure-the-facebook-trigger).\n4. Optional: [Add an app secret](#optional-add-an-app-secret).\n5. [App Review](#app-review): Only required if your app's users don't have roles on the app itself. If you're creating the app for your own internal purposes, this isn't necessary.\n\nRefer to the detailed instructions below for each step.\n\n### Create a Meta app\n\nTo create a Meta app:\n\n1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps){:target=_blank .external-link} and select **Create App**.\n2. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don\u2019t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.\n3. Select **Other**, then select **Next**.\n4. Select **Business** and **Next**.\n5. Complete the essential information:\n    * Add an **App name**.\n    * Add an **App contact email**.\n    * Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.\n1. Select **Create app**.\n1. The **Add products to your app** page opens.\n1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.\n1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app \"Live.\")\n1. Select **Save changes**.\n1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.\n1. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.\n6. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select **Webhooks**.\n7. The **Webhooks** product opens.\n\nRefer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.\n\nFor more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n### Generate an App Access Token\n\nNext, create an app access token to be used by your n8n credential and the Webhooks product:\n\n1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n2. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.\n3. In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.\n4. Select **Generate Access Token**.\n5. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.\n\n    /// warning | App unavailable\n    You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.\n    ///\n\n5. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**. Save this token somewhere else, too, since you'll need it for the Webhooks configuration.\n6. Save your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on generating the token.\n\n### Configure the Facebook Trigger\n\nNow that you have a token, you can configure the Facebook Trigger node:\n\n1. In your Meta app, copy the **App ID** from the top navigation bar.\n1. In n8n, open your Facebook Trigger node.\n2. Paste the **App ID** into the **APP ID** field.\n3. Select **Test step** to shift the trigger into listening mode.\n6. Return to the tab or window where your Meta app's **Webhooks** product configuration is open.\n7. **Subscribe** to the objects you want to receive Facebook Trigger notifications about. For each subscription:\n    1. Copy the **Webhook URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Callback URL** in your Meta App.\n    1. Enter the **Access Token** you copied above as the **Verify token**.\n    1. Select **Verify and save**. (This step fails if you don't have your n8n trigger listening.)\n    1. Some webhook subscriptions, like **User**, prompt you to subscribe to individual events. Subscribe to the events you're interested in.\n    1. You can send some **Test** events from Meta to confirm things are working. If you send a test event, verify its receipt in n8n.\n\nRefer to the [Facebook Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/) documentation for more information.\n\n### Optional: Add an App Secret\n\nFor added security, Meta recommends adding an **App Secret**. This signs all API calls with the `appsecret_proof` parameter. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key.\n\nTo generate an App Secret:\n\n1.

To use this feature, it helps to have some knowledge of basic Git concepts. n8n doesn't implement all Git functionality: you shouldn't view n8n's source control as full version control.\n\n\n/// note | New to Git and source control?\nIf you're new to Git, don't panic. You don't need to learn Git to use n8n. This document explains the concepts you need. You do need some Git knowledge to set up the source control, as this involves work in your Git provider.\n///\n/// note | Familiar with Git and source control?\nIf you're familiar with Git, don't rely on behaviors matching exactly. In particular, be aware that source control in n8n doesn't support a pull request-style review and merge process, unless you do this outside n8n in your Git provider.\n///\n\nThis page introduces the Git concepts and terminology used in n8n. It doesn't cover everything you need to set up and manage a repository. The person doing the [Setup](/source-control-environments/setup/) should have some familiarity with Git and with their Git hosting provider.\n\n/// note | This is a brief introduction\nGit is a complex topic. This section provides a brief introduction to the key terms you need when using environments in n8n. If you want to learn about Git in depth, refer to [GitHub | Git and GitHub learning resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n///\n## Git overview\n\n[Git](https://git-scm.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a tool for managing, tracking, and collaborating on multiple versions of documents. It's the basis for widely used platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n## Branches: Multiple copies of a project\n\nGit uses branches to maintain multiple copies of a document alongside each other. Every branch has its own version. A common pattern is to have a main branch, and then everyone who wants to contribute to the project works on their own branch (copy). When they finish their work, their branch is merged back into the main branch.\n\n![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/simple-git-branch.png)\n\n## Local and remote: Moving work between your machine and a Git provider\n\nA common pattern when using Git is to install Git on your own computer, and use a Git provider such as GitHub to work with Git in the cloud. In effect, you have a Git repository (project) on GitHub, and work with copies of it on your local machine.\n\nn8n uses this pattern for source control: you'll work with your workflows on your n8n instance, but send them to your Git provider to store them.\n\n## Push, pull, and commit\n\nn8n uses three key Git processes:\n\n* **Push**: send work from your instance to Git. This saves a copy of your workflows and tags, as well as credential and variable stubs, to Git. You can choose which workflows you want to save.\n* **Pull**: get the workflows, tags, and variables from Git and load it into n8n. \n\n    /// warning | Pulling overwrites your work\n    If you have made changes to a workflow in n8n, you must push the changes to Git before pulling. When you pull, it overwrites any changes you've made if they aren't stored in Git.\n    ///\n\t\t\n* **Commit**: a commit in n8n is a single occurrence of pushing work to Git. In n8n, commit and push happen at the same time.\n\nRefer to [Push and pull](/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/) for detailed information about how n8n interacts with Git.",

[Generate a GitHub personal access token](#generate-personal-access-token).\n2. [Set up the credential](#set-up-the-credential).\n\nRefer to the sections below for detailed instructions.\n\n### Generate personal access token\n\n/// note | Recommended access token type\nn8n recommends using a personal access token (classic). GitHub's fine-grained personal access tokens are still in beta and can't access all endpoints.\n///\n\nTo generate your personal access token:\n\n1. If you haven't done so already, verify your email address with GitHub. Refer to [Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.\n2.

In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n4. In the left navigation, under **Personal access tokens**, select **Tokens (classic)**.\n5. Select **Generate new token > Generate new token (classic)**.\n6. Enter a descriptive name for your token in the **Note** field, like `n8n integration`.\n7. Select the **Expiration** you'd like for the token, or select **No expiration**.\n8. Select **Scopes** for your token. For most of the n8n GitHub nodes, add the `repo` scope.\n    - A token without assigned scopes can only access public information.\n    - Refer to \n9. Select **Generate token**.\n10. Copy the token.\n\nRefer to [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. Refer to [Scopes for OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on GitHub scopes.\n\n### Set up the credential\n\nThen, in your n8n credential:\n\n1. If you aren't using GitHub Enterprise Server, don't change the **GitHub server** URL.\n    - If you're using [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server){:target=_blank .external-link}, update **GitHub server** to match the URL for your server.\n2. Enter your **User** name as it appears in your GitHub profile.\n3. Enter the **Access Token** you generated above.\n\n## Using OAuth2\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cloud-oauth-button.md\"\n\nIf you're [self-hosting n8n](/hosting/), create a new GitHub [OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps){:target=_blank .external-link}:\n\n1. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n2.

This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/authorize`. The temporary credentials are sent here to prompt a user to complete authorization.\n- An **Access Token URL**: This is the URI used for the initial request for temporary credentials. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/request` or `/oauth1/token`.\n- A **Consumer Key**: Also known as the client key, like a username. This specifies the `oauth_consumer_key` to use for the call.\n- A **Consumer Secret**: Also known as the client secret, like a password.\n- A **Request Token URL**: This is the URI used to switch from temporary credentials to long-lived credentials after authorization. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/access`.\n- Select the **Signature Method** the auth handshake uses. This specifies the `oauth_signature_method` to use for the call. Options include:\n\t- **HMAC-SHA1**\n\t- **HMAC-SHA256**\n\t- **HMAC-SHA512**\n\nFor most OAuth1 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration to generate the values for most of these fields. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.\n\nRead more about [OAuth1](https://oauth.net/1/){:target=_blank .external-link} and the [OAuth1 authorization flow](https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n## Using OAuth2\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth2 authentication.\n\nRequirements to configure this credential depend on the **Grant Type** selected. Refer to [OAuth Grant Types](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/) for more information on each grant type.\n\nFor most OAuth2 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.\n\nRead more about [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n### Authorization Code grant type\n\nUse Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. The auth flow uses the redirect URL to return the user to the client. Then the application gets the authorization code from the URL and uses it to request an access token. Refer to [Authorization Code Request](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.\n\nTo configure this credential, select **Authorization Code** as the **Grant Type**.\n\nThen enter:\n\n- An **Authorization URL**\n- An **Access Token URL**\n- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.\n- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.\n- _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.\n- _Optional:_ Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.\n- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:\n\t- **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.\n\t- **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.\n- _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.\n\n### Client Credentials grant type\n\nUse the Client Credentials grant type when applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user. Refer to [Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.\n\nTo configure this credential, select **Client Credentials** as the **Grant Type**.\n\nThen enter:\n\n- An **Access Token URL**: The URL to hit to begin the OAuth2 flow. Typically this URL ends in `/token`.\n- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to use to log in to the client.\n- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in to the client.\n- _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. Most services don't support scopes for Client Credentials grant types; only enter scopes here if yours does.\n- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:\n\t- **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.\n\t- **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.\n- _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.\n\n### PKCE grant type\n\nProof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant type is an extension to the Authorization Code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.\n\nTo configure this credential, select **PKCE** as the **Grant Type**.\n\nThen enter:\n\n- An **Authorization URL**\n- An **Access Token URL**\n- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.\n- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.\n- _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.\n- _Optional:_ Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.\n- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:\n\t- **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.\n\t- **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.\n- _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.\n\n## Using query auth\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as a single key/value query parameter. (For multiple query parameters, use [Custom Auth](#using-custom-auth).)\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n- A query parameter key or **Name**\n- A query parameter **Value**\n\n## Using custom auth\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as multiple key/value query parameters or you need more flexibility than the other generic auth options.\n\nThe **Custom Auth** credential expects JSON data to define your credential. You can use `headers`, `qs`, `body` or a mix.

An SSH tunnel lets un-encrypted traffic pass over an encrypted connection and enables authorized remote access to servers protected from outside connections by a firewall.\n\nTo set up your database connection credential:\n\n1. Enter your database's hostname as the **Host** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the hostname:\n\n    ```\n    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'hostname';\n    ```\n\n2. Enter your database's name as the **Database** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the database name:\n\n    ```\n    SHOW DATABASES;\n    ```\n\n3.

Enter the **Connect Timeout** you'd like the node to use. The Connect Timeout is the number of milliseconds during the initial database connection the node should wait before timing out. n8n defaults to `1000` which is the default used by MySQL of 10 seconds. If you want to match your database's `connect_timeout`, run this query to get it, then multiply by 100 before entering it in n8n:\n\n    ```\n    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'connect_timeout';\n    ```\n\n7.

Enter the **SSH Host**. n8n uses this host to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n    3. Enter the **SSH Port**. n8n uses this port to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n    4. Enter the **SSH User** to connect with. n8n uses this user to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n    5.

In Nextcloud, open your **Administrator Security Settings**.\n2. Find the **Add client** section under **OAuth 2.0 clients**.\n3. Enter a **Name** for your client, like `n8n integration`.\n4. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Redirection URI**.\n5. Then select **Add** in Nextcloud.\n6. In n8n, update the **Authorization URL** to replace `https://nextcloud.example.com` with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, the Authorization URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/authorize`.\n7. In n8n, update the **Access Token URL** to replace `https://nextcloud.example.com` with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, the Access Token URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`.\n\n    /// note | Pretty URL configuration\n    The **Authorization URL** and **Access Token URL** assume that you've configured Nextcloud to use [Pretty URLs](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#pretty-urls){:target=_blank .external-link}. If you haven't, you must add `/index.php/` between your Nextcloud URL and the `/apps/oauth2` portion, for example: `https://cloud.n8n.com/index.php/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`.\n    ///\n    \n8. Copy the Nextcloud **Client Identifier** for your OAuth2 client and enter it as the **Client ID** in n8n.\n9. Copy the Nextcloud **Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** in n8n.\n10. In n8n, to create your **Web DAV URL**: If Nextcloud is in the root of your domain, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/remote.php/dav/`. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, your WebDAV URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/remote.php/dav`.\n    - If you have Nextcloud installed in a subdirectory, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/<subdirectory>/remote.php/dav/`. Replace `<subdirectory>` with the subdirectory Nextcloud's installed in.\n    - Refer to Nextcloud's [Third-party WebDAV clients](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/en/files/access_webdav.html#third-party-webdav-clients){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information on constructing your WebDAV URL.\n\nRefer to the Nextcloud [OAuth2 Configuration documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/oauth2.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more detailed instructions.",

Some providers call this the \"region slug.\"\n- An **Access Key ID**: Enter the S3 access key your S3 provider uses to access the bucket or space. Some providers call this API keys.\n- A **Secret Access Key**: Enter the secret access key for the **Access Key ID**.\n- **Force Path Style**: When turned on, the connection uses path-style addressing for buckets.\n- **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.\n\nMore detailed instructions for DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi follow. If you're using a different provider, refer to their documentation for more information. \n\n### Using DigitalOcean Spaces\n\nTo configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces:\n\n1. In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open **Settings**. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend `https://` to that endpoint and enter it as the **S3 Endpoint** in n8n.\n    - Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in.\n2. For the **Region**, enter the region your bucket's located in, for example, `nyc3`.\n    - If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter `us-east-1` instead.\n3. From your DigitalOceans control panel, go to [**API**](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/spaces){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link}.\n4. Open the **Spaces Keys** tab.\n5. Select **Generate New Key**.\n6. Enter a **Name** for your key, like `n8n integration` and select the checkmark.\n7. Copy the **Key** displayed next to the name and enter this as the **Access Key ID** in n8n.\n8. Copy the **Secret** value and enter this as the **Secret Access Key** in n8n.\n    - Refer to [Sharing Access to Buckets with Access Keys](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/manage-access/#access-keys){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} for more information on generating the key and secret.\n9. Keep the **Force Path Style** toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format.\n10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:\n    - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.\n    - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.\n\nRefer to DigitalOcean's [Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} for more information.\n\n### Using Wasabi\n\nTo configure the credential for use with Wasabi:\n\n1. For the **S3 Endpoint**, enter the service URL for your bucket's region. Start it with `https://`.\n    - Refer to [What are the service URLs for Wasabi's different storage regions?](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015106031-What-are-the-service-URLs-for-Wasabi-s-different-storage-regions){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} to identify the correct URL.\n2. For the **Region**, enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered `https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com` as the **S3 Endpoint**, `us-east-2` is the region.\n3. Log into you Wasabi Console as the root user.\n4. Open the **Menu** and select **Access Keys**.\n5. Select **CREATE NEW ACCESS KEY**.\n6. Select whether the key is for the **Root User** or a **Sub-User** and select **CREATE**.\n7. Copy the **Access Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Access Key ID**.\n8. Copy the **Secret Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Secret Access Key**.\n    - Refer to [Creating a Wasabi API Access Key Set](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019677192-Creating-a-Wasabi-API-Access-Key-Set){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} for more information on generating the key and secret.\n9. Wasabi recommends turning on the **Force Path Style** toggle \"because the path-style offers the greatest flexibility in bucket names, avoiding domain name issues.\" Refer to the Wasabi [REST API Introduction](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction){:target=\"_blank\" .external-link} for more information.\n10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:\n    - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.\n    - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.",

Refer to [Slack credentials | Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) for more information.\n\nYou must add the appropriate scopes to your Slack app for this trigger node to work.\n\nThe node requires scopes for the [conversations.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list){:target=blank .external-link} and [users.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list){:target=blank .external-link} methods at minimum. Check out the [Scopes | Slack credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#scopes) list for a more complete list of scopes.\n\n## Common issues\n\nHere are some common errors and issues with the Slack Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\n\n### Workflow only works in testing or production\n\nSlack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL. \n\nYou may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.\n\nTo work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:\n\n/// warning | Halts production traffic\nThis temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.\n///\n\n1. Go to your workflow page.\n2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.\n3. Edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL.\n4. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.\n5. When you finish testing, edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL.\n6. Toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.\n\n### Token expired\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/token-rotation.md\"",

A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality.

Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou need the following installed on your development machine:\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/prerequisites.md\"\n\nYou need some understanding of:\n\n- JavaScript/TypeScript\n- REST APIs\n- git\n\n## Build your node\n\nIn this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/){:target=_blank .external-link}. You'll create a node that uses two of NASA's services: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Mars Rover Photos. To keep the code examples short, the node won't implement every available option for the Mars Rover Photos endpoint.\n\n/// note | Existing node\nn8n has a built-in NASA node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.\n///\n### Step 1: Set up the project\n\n\nn8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter. \n\nClone the repository and navigate into the directory:\n\n1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.\n2. Clone your new repository:\n\t\t```shell\n\t\tgit clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-nasa-pics\n\t\tcd n8n-nodes-nasa-pics\n\t\t```\n\nThe starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:\n\n* `nodes/ExampleNode`\n* `nodes/HTTPBin`\n* `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`\n* `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`\n\nNow create the following directories and files:\n\n`nodes/NasaPics`  \n`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.json`  \n`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.ts`  \n`credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`  \n\nThese are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.\n\nNow install the project dependencies:\n\n```shell\nnpm i\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add an icon\n\nSave the NASA SVG logo from [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg){:target=_blank .external-link} as `nasapics.svg` in `nodes/NasaPics/`.\n\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/node-icons.md\"\n\n\n### Step 3: Create the node\n\nEvery node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.\n\nIn this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.\n\n#### Step 3.1: Imports\n\nStart by adding the import statements:\n\n```typescript\nimport { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';\n```\n\n#### Step 3.2: Create the main class\n\nThe node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.\n\n/// note | Class names and file names\nMake sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `NasaPics`, the filename must be `NasaPics.node.ts`.\n///\n```typescript\nexport class NasaPics implements INodeType {\n\tdescription: INodeTypeDescription = {\n\t\t// Basic node details will go here\n\t\tproperties: [\n\t\t// Resources and operations will go here\n\t\t]\n\t};\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3.3: Add node details\n\nAll nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name, icon, and the basic information for making a request using the node. Add the following to the `description`:\n\n```typescript\ndisplayName: 'NASA Pics',\nname: 'NasaPics',\nicon: 'file:nasapics.svg',\ngroup: ['transform'],\nversion: 1,\nsubtitle: '={{$parameter[\"operation\"] + \": \" + $parameter[\"resource\"]}}',\ndescription: 'Get data from NASAs API',\ndefaults: {\n\tname: 'NASA Pics',\n},\ninputs: ['main'],\noutputs: ['main'],\ncredentials: [\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'NasaPicsApi',\n\t\trequired: true,\n\t},\n],\nrequestDefaults: {\n\tbaseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov',\n\theaders: {\n\t\tAccept: 'application/json',\n\t\t'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n\t},\n},\n```\n\nn8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, `description`, and `subtitle`.\n\n#### Step 3.4: Add resources\n\nThe resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access two of NASA's API endpoints: `planetary/apod` and `mars-photos`. This means you need to define two resource options in `NasaPics.node.ts`. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:\n\n```typescript\nproperties: [\n\t{\n\t\tdisplayName: 'Resource',\n\t\tname: 'resource',\n\t\ttype: 'options',\n\t\tnoDataExpression: true,\n\t\toptions: [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tname: 'Astronomy Picture of the Day',\n\t\t\t\tvalue: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tname: 'Mars Rover Photos',\n\t\t\t\tvalue: 'marsRoverPhotos',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t],\n\t\tdefault: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',\n\t},\n\t// Operations will go here\n\n]\n```\n\n`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.\n\n#### Step 3.5: Add operations\n\nThe operations object defines the available operations on a resource.\n\nIn a declarative-style node, the operations object includes `routing` (within the `options` array). This sets up the details of the API call.\n\nAdd the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:\n\n```typescript\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Operation',\n\tname: 'operation',\n\ttype: 'options',\n\tnoDataExpression: true,\n\tdisplayOptions: {\n\t\tshow: {\n\t\t\tresource: [\n\t\t\t\t'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\toptions: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'Get',\n\t\t\tvalue: 'get',\n\t\t\taction: 'Get the APOD',\n\t\t\tdescription: 'Get the Astronomy Picture of the day',\n\t\t\trouting: {\n\t\t\t\trequest: {\n\t\t\t\t\tmethod: 'GET',\n\t\t\t\t\turl: '/planetary/apod',\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t],\n\tdefault: 'get',\n},\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Operation',\n\tname: 'operation',\n\ttype: 'options',\n\tnoDataExpression: true,\n\tdisplayOptions: {\n\t\tshow: {\n\t\t\tresource: [\n\t\t\t\t'marsRoverPhotos',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\toptions: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'Get',\n\t\t\tvalue: 'get',\n\t\t\taction: 'Get Mars Rover photos',\n\t\t\tdescription: 'Get photos from the Mars Rover',\n\t\t\trouting: {\n\t\t\t\trequest: {\n\t\t\t\t\tmethod: 'GET',\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t],\n\tdefault: 'get',\n},\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Rover name',\n\tdescription: 'Choose which Mars Rover to get a photo from',\n\trequired: true,\n\tname: 'roverName',\n\ttype: 'options',\n\toptions: [\n\t\t{name: 'Curiosity', value: 'curiosity'},\n\t\t{name: 'Opportunity', value: 'opportunity'},\n\t\t{name: 'Perseverance', value: 'perseverance'},\n\t\t{name: 'Spirit', value: 'spirit'},\n\t],\n\trouting: {\n\t\trequest: {\n\t\t\turl: '=/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/{{$value}}/photos',\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\tdefault: 'curiosity',\n\tdisplayOptions: {\n\t\tshow: {\n\t\t\tresource: [\n\t\t\t\t'marsRoverPhotos',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t},\n\t},\n},\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Date',\n\tdescription: 'Earth date',\n\trequired: true,\n\tname: 'marsRoverDate',\n\ttype: 'dateTime',\n\tdefault:'',\n\tdisplayOptions: {\n\t\tshow: {\n\t\t\tresource: [\n\t\t\t\t'marsRoverPhotos',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\trouting: {\n\t\trequest: {\n\t\t\t// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string\n\t\t\tqs: {\n\t\t\t\tearth_date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t},\n},\n// Optional/additional fields will go here\n```\n\nThis code creates two operations: one to get today's APOD image, and another to send a get request for photos from one of the Mars Rovers. The object named `roverName` requires the user to choose which Rover they want photos from. The `routing` object in the Mars Rover operation references this to create the URL for the API call.\n\n#### Step 3.6: Optional fields\n\nMost APIs, including the NASA API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.\n\nFor this tutorial, you'll add one additional field, to allow users to pick a date to use with the APOD endpoint. Add the following to the properties array:\n\n```typescript\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Additional Fields',\n\tname: 'additionalFields',\n\ttype: 'collection',\n\tdefault: {},\n\tplaceholder: 'Add Field',\n\tdisplayOptions: {\n\t\tshow: {\n\t\t\tresource: [\n\t\t\t\t'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\toperation: [\n\t\t\t\t'get',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\toptions: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tdisplayName: 'Date',\n\t\t\tname: 'apodDate',\n\t\t\ttype: 'dateTime',\n\t\t\tdefault: '',\n\t\t\trouting: {\n\t\t\t\trequest: {\n\t\t\t\t\t// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string\n\t\t\t\t\tqs: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdate: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}',\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t],\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n}\n```\n\n\n### Step 4: Set up authentication\n\nThe NASA API requires users to authenticate with an API key.\n\nAdd the following to `nasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport {\n\tIAuthenticateGeneric,\n\tICredentialType,\n\tINodeProperties,\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\nexport class NasaPicsApi implements ICredentialType {\n\tname = 'NasaPicsApi';\n\tdisplayName = 'NASA Pics API';\n\t// Uses the link to this tutorial as an example\n\t// Replace with your own docs links when building your own nodes\n\tdocumentationUrl = 'https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/';\n\tproperties: INodeProperties[] = [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tdisplayName: 'API Key',\n\t\t\tname: 'apiKey',\n\t\t\ttype: 'string',\n\t\t\tdefault: '',\n\t\t},\n\t];\n\tauthenticate = {\n\t\ttype: 'generic',\n\t\tproperties: {\n\t\t\tqs: {\n\t\t\t\t'api_key': '={{$credentials.apiKey}}'\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t} as IAuthenticateGeneric;\n}\n```\n\nFor more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/).\n\n\n### Step 5: Add node metadata\n\nMetadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.json`.\n\nAdd the following code to the JSON file:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"node\": \"n8n-nodes-base.NasaPics\",\n\t\"nodeVersion\": \"1.0\",\n\t\"codexVersion\": \"1.0\",\n\t\"categories\": [\n\t\t\"Miscellaneous\"\n\t],\n\t\"resources\": {\n\t\t\"credentialDocumentation\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"url\": \"\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t],\n\t\t\"primaryDocumentation\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"url\": \"\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/).\n\n### Step 6: Update the npm package details\n\nYour npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:\n\n```json\n{\n\t// All node names must start with \"n8n-nodes-\"\n\t\"name\": \"n8n-nodes-nasapics\",\n\t\"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n\t\"description\": \"n8n node to call NASA's APOD and Mars Rover Photo services.\",\n\t\"keywords\": [\n\t\t// This keyword is required for community nodes\n\t\t\"n8n-community-node-package\"\n\t],\n\t\"license\": \"MIT\",\n\t\"homepage\": \"https://n8n.io\",\n\t\"author\": {\n\t\t\"name\": \"Test\",\n\t\t\"email\": \"test@example.com\"\n\t},\n\t\"repository\": {\n\t\t\"type\": \"git\",\n\t\t// Change the git remote to your own repository\n\t\t// Add the new URL here\n\t\t\"url\": \"git+<your-repo-url>\"\n\t},\n\t\"main\": \"index.js\",\n\t\"scripts\": {\n\t\t// don't change\n\t},\n\t\"files\": [\n\t\t\"dist\"\n\t],\n\t// Link the credentials and node\n\t\"n8n\": {\n\t\t\"n8nNodesApiVersion\": 1,\n\t\t\"credentials\": [\n\t\t\t\"dist/credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.js\"\n\t\t],\n\t\t\"nodes\": [\n\t\t\t\"dist/nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.js\"\n\t\t]\n\t},\n\t\"devDependencies\": {\n\t\t// don't change\n\t},\n\t\"peerDependencies\": {\n\t\t// don't change\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nYou need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n## Test your node\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/testing.md\"\n\n## Next steps\n\n* [Deploy your node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/).\n* View an example of a declarative node: n8n's [Brevo node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo){:target=_blank .external-link}.

You'll create a node that implements one piece of SendGrid functionality: create a contact.\n\n/// note | Existing node\nn8n has a built-in SendGrid node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.\n///\n### Step 1: Set up the project\n\nn8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter. \n\nClone the repository and navigate into the directory:\n\n1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate){:target=_blank .external-link} from the template repository.\n2. Clone your new repository:\n\t\t```shell\n\t\tgit clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-friendgrid\n\t\tcd n8n-nodes-friendgrid\n\t\t```\n\nThe starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:\n\n* `nodes/ExampleNode`\n* `nodes/HTTPBin`\n* `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`\n* `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`\n\nNow create the following directories and files:\n\n`nodes/FriendGrid`  \n`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.json`  \n`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts`  \n`credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`  \n\nThese are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.\n\nNow install the project dependencies:\n\n```shell\nnpm i\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add an icon\n\nSave the SendGrid SVG logo from [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/SendGrid/sendGrid.svg){:target=_blank .external-link} as `friendGrid.svg` in `nodes/FriendGrid/`.\n\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/node-icons.md\"\n\n\n### Step 3: Define the node in the base file\n\nEvery node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.\n\nIn this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.\n\n#### Step 3.1: Imports\n\nStart by adding the import statements:\n\n```typescript\nimport {\n\tIExecuteFunctions,\n} from 'n8n-core';\n\nimport {\n\tIDataObject,\n\tINodeExecutionData,\n\tINodeType,\n\tINodeTypeDescription,\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\nimport {\n\tOptionsWithUri,\n} from 'request';\n```\n\n#### Step 3.2: Create the main class\n\nThe node must export an interface that implements `INodeType`. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.\n\n/// note | Class names and file names\nMake sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `FriendGrid`, the filename must be `FriendGrid.node.ts`.\n///\n```typescript\nexport class FriendGrid implements INodeType {\n\tdescription: INodeTypeDescription = {\n\t\t// Basic node details will go here\n\t\tproperties: [\n\t\t\t// Resources and operations will go here\n\t\t],\n\t};\n\t// The execute method will go here\n\tasync execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3.3: Add node details\n\nAll programmatic nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name and icon. Add the following to the `description`:\n\n```typescript\ndisplayName: 'FriendGrid',\nname: 'friendGrid',\nicon: 'file:friendGrid.svg',\ngroup: ['transform'],\nversion: 1,\ndescription: 'Consume SendGrid API',\ndefaults: {\n\tname: 'FriendGrid',\n},\ninputs: ['main'],\noutputs: ['main'],\ncredentials: [\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'friendGridApi',\n\t\trequired: true,\n\t},\n],\n```\n\nn8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, and `description`.\n\n#### Step 3.4: Add the resource\n\nThe resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access one of SendGrid's API endpoints: `/v3/marketing/contacts`. This means you need to define a resource for this endpoint. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:\n\n```typescript\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Resource',\n\tname: 'resource',\n\ttype: 'options',\n\toptions: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'Contact',\n\t\t\tvalue: 'contact',\n\t\t},\n\t],\n\tdefault: 'contact',\n\tnoDataExpression: true,\n\trequired: true,\n\tdescription: 'Create a new contact',\n},\n```\n\n`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.\n\n#### Step 3.5: Add operations\n\nThe operations object defines what you can do with a resource. It usually relates to REST API verbs (GET, POST, and so on). In this tutorial, there's one operation: create a contact. It has one required field, the email address for the contact the user creates.\n\nAdd the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:\n\n```typescript\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Operation',\n\tname: 'operation',\n\ttype: 'options',\n\tdisplayOptions: {\n\t\tshow: {\n\t\t\tresource: [\n\t\t\t\t'contact',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\toptions: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'Create',\n\t\t\tvalue: 'create',\n\t\t\tdescription: 'Create a contact',\n\t\t\taction: 'Create a contact',\n\t\t},\n\t],\n\tdefault: 'create',\n\tnoDataExpression: true,\n},\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Email',\n\tname: 'email',\n\ttype: 'string',\n\trequired: true,\n\tdisplayOptions: {\n\t\tshow: {\n\t\t\toperation: [\n\t\t\t\t'create',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\tresource: [\n\t\t\t\t'contact',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\tdefault:'',\n\tplaceholder: 'name@email.com',\n\tdescription:'Primary email for the contact',\n},\n```\n\n#### Step 3.6: Add optional fields\n\nMost APIs, including the SendGrid API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.\n\nFor this tutorial, you'll add two additional fields, to allow users to enter the contact's first name and last name. Add the following to the properties array:\n\n```typescript\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Additional Fields',\n\tname: 'additionalFields',\n\ttype: 'collection',\n\tplaceholder: 'Add Field',\n\tdefault: {},\n\tdisplayOptions: {\n\t\tshow: {\n\t\t\tresource: [\n\t\t\t\t'contact',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\toperation: [\n\t\t\t\t'create',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\toptions: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tdisplayName: 'First Name',\n\t\t\tname: 'firstName',\n\t\t\ttype: 'string',\n\t\t\tdefault: '',\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tdisplayName: 'Last Name',\n\t\t\tname: 'lastName',\n\t\t\ttype: 'string',\n\t\t\tdefault: '',\n\t\t},\n\t],\n},\n```\n\n### Step 4: Add the execute method\n\nYou've set up the node UI and basic information. It's time to map the node UI to API requests, and make the node actually do something.\n\nThe `execute` method runs every time the node runs. In this method, you have access to the input items and to the parameters that the user set in the UI, including the credentials.\n\nAdd the following the `execute` method in the `FriendGrid.node.ts`:\n\n```typescript\n// Handle data coming from previous nodes\nconst items = this.getInputData();\nlet responseData;\nconst returnData = [];\nconst resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string;\nconst operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string;\n\n// For each item, make an API call to create a contact\nfor (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {\n\tif (resource === 'contact') {\n\t\tif (operation === 'create') {\n\t\t\t// Get email input\n\t\t\tconst email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string;\n\t\t\t// Get additional fields input\n\t\t\tconst additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', i) as IDataObject;\n\t\t\tconst data: IDataObject = {\n\t\t\t\temail,\n\t\t\t};\n\n\t\t\tObject.assign(data, additionalFields);\n\n\t\t\t// Make HTTP request according to https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/\n\t\t\tconst options: OptionsWithUri = {\n\t\t\t\theaders: {\n\t\t\t\t\t'Accept': 'application/json',\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\tmethod: 'PUT',\n\t\t\t\tbody: {\n\t\t\t\t\tcontacts: [\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata,\n\t\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\turi: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`,\n\t\t\t\tjson: true,\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t\tresponseData = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(this, 'friendGridApi', options);\n\t\t\treturnData.push(responseData);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n// Map data to n8n data structure\nreturn [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(returnData)];\n```\n\nNote the following lines of this code:\n\n```typescript\nconst items = this.getInputData();\n... \nfor (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {\n\t...\n\tconst email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string;\n\t...\n}\n```\n\nUsers can provide data in two ways:\n\n* Entered directly in the node fields\n* By mapping data from earlier nodes in the workflow\n\n`getInputData()`, and the subsequent loop, allows the node to handle situations where data comes from a previous node. This includes supporting multiple inputs. This means that if, for example, the previous node outputs contact information for five people, your FriendGrid node can create five contacts.\n\n\n### Step 5: Set up authentication\n\nThe SendGrid API requires users to authenticate with an API key.\n\nAdd the following to `FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`\n\n```typescript\nimport {\n\tIAuthenticateGeneric,\n\tICredentialTestRequest,\n\tICredentialType,\n\tINodeProperties,\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\nexport class FriendGridApi implements ICredentialType {\n\tname = 'friendGridApi';\n\tdisplayName = 'FriendGrid API';\n\tproperties: INodeProperties[] = [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tdisplayName: 'API Key',\n\t\t\tname: 'apiKey',\n\t\t\ttype: 'string',\n\t\t\tdefault: '',\n\t\t},\n\t];\n\n\tauthenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {\n\t\ttype: 'generic',\n\t\tproperties: {\n\t\t\theaders: {\n\t\t\t\tAuthorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.apiKey}}',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t};\n\n\ttest: ICredentialTestRequest = {\n\t\trequest: {\n\t\t\tbaseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3',\n\t\t\turl: '/marketing/contacts',\n\t\t},\n\t};\n}\n\n```\n\nFor more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/).\n\n### Step 6: Add node metadata\n\nMetadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.json`.\n\nAdd the following code to the JSON file:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"node\": \"n8n-nodes-base.FriendGrid\",\n\t\"nodeVersion\": \"1.0\",\n\t\"codexVersion\": \"1.0\",\n\t\"categories\": [\n\t\t\"Miscellaneous\"\n\t],\n\t\"resources\": {\n\t\t\"credentialDocumentation\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"url\": \"\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t],\n\t\t\"primaryDocumentation\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"url\": \"\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/).\n\n\n### Step 7: Update the npm package details\n\nYour npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:\n\n```json\n{\n\t// All node names must start with \"n8n-nodes-\"\n\t\"name\": \"n8n-nodes-friendgrid\",\n\t\"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n\t\"description\": \"n8n node to create contacts in SendGrid\",\n\t\"keywords\": [\n\t\t// This keyword is required for community nodes\n\t\t\"n8n-community-node-package\"\n\t],\n\t\"license\": \"MIT\",\n\t\"homepage\": \"https://n8n.io\",\n\t\"author\": {\n\t\t\"name\": \"Test\",\n\t\t\"email\": \"test@example.com\"\n\t},\n\t\"repository\": {\n\t\t\"type\": \"git\",\n\t\t// Change the git remote to your own repository\n\t\t// Add the new URL here\n\t\t\"url\": \"git+<your-repo-url>\"\n\t},\n\t\"main\": \"index.js\",\n\t\"scripts\": {\n\t\t// don't change\n\t},\n\t\"files\": [\n\t\t\"dist\"\n\t],\n\t// Link the credentials and node\n\t\"n8n\": {\n\t\t\"n8nNodesApiVersion\": 1,\n\t\t\"credentials\": [\n\t\t\t\"dist/credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.js\"\n\t\t],\n\t\t\"nodes\": [\n\t\t\t\"dist/nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.js\"\n\t\t]\n\t},\n\t\"devDependencies\": {\n\t\t// don't change\n\t},\n\t\"peerDependencies\": {\n\t\t// don't change\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nYou need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n\n\n## Test your node\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/testing.md\"\n\n## Next steps\n\n* [Deploy your node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/).\n* View an example of a programmatic node: n8n's [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost){:target=_blank .external-link}. This is an example of a more complex programmatic node structure.\n* Learn about [node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/).\n* Make sure you understand key concepts: [item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) and [data structures](/data/data-structure/).",

This document provides guidance on good code practices for node building. It focuses on code details. For UI standards and UX guidance, refer to [Node UI design](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design/).\n\n## Use the linter\n\nThe n8n node linter provides automatic checking for many of the node-building standards. You should ensure your node passes the linter's checks before publishing it. Refer to the [n8n node linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter/) documentation for more information.\n\n## Use the starter\n\nThe n8n node starter project includes a recommended setup, dependencies (including the linter), and examples to help you get started. Begin new projects with the [starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n## Write in TypeScript\n\nAll n8n code is TypeScript. Writing your nodes in TypeScript can speed up development and reduce bugs.\n\n## Detailed guidelines for writing a node\n\nThese guidelines apply to any node you build. \n\n### Resources and operations\n\nIf your node can perform several operations, call the parameter that sets the operation `Operation`. If your node can do these operations on more than one resource, create a `Resource` parameter. The following code sample shows a basic resource and operations setup:\n\n```js\nexport const ExampleNode implements INodeType {\n    description: {\n        displayName: 'Example Node',\n        ...\n        properties: [\n            {\n                displayName: 'Resource',\n                name: 'resource',\n                type: 'options',\n                options: [\n                    {\n                        name: 'Resource One',\n                        value: 'resourceOne'\n                    },\n                    {\n                        name: 'Resource Two',\n                        value: 'resourceTwo'\n                    }\n                ],\n                default: 'resourceOne'\n            },\n            {\n                displayName: 'Operation',\n                name: 'operation',\n                type: 'options',\n                // Only show these operations for Resource One\n                displayOptions: {\n                    show: {\n                        resource: [\n                            'resourceOne'\n                        ]\n                    }\n                },\n                options: [\n                    {\n                        name: 'Create',\n                        value: 'create',\n                        description: 'Create an instance of Resource One'\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Reuse internal parameter names\n\nAll resource and operation fields in an n8n node have two settings: a display name, set using the `name` parameter, and an internal name, set using the `value` parameter. Reusing the internal name for fields allows n8n to preserve user-entered data if a user switches operations. \n\nFor example: you're building a node with a resource named 'Order'. This resource has several operations, including Get, Edit, and Delete. Each of these operations uses an order ID to perform the operation on the specified order. You need to display an ID field for the user. This field has a display label, and an internal name. By using the same internal name (set in `value`) for the operation ID field on each resource, a user can enter the ID with the Get operation selected, and not lose it if they switch to Edit.\n\nWhen reusing the internal name, you must ensure that only one field is visible to the user at a time. You can control this using `displayOptions`.\n\n## Detailed guidelines for writing a programmatic-style node\n\nThese guidelines apply when building nodes using the programmatic node-building style. They aren't relevant when using the declarative style. For more information on different node-building styles, refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/).\n\n### Don't change incoming data\n\nNever change the incoming data a node receives (data accessible with `this.getInputData()`) as all nodes share it. If you need to add, change, or delete data, clone the incoming data and return the new data. If you don't do this, sibling nodes that execute after the current one will operate on the altered data and process incorrect data.\n\nIt's not necessary to always clone all the data. For example, if a node changes the binary data but not the JSON data, you can create a new item that reuses the reference to the JSON item.\n\n\n### Use the built in request library\n\nSome third-party services have their own libraries on npm, which make it easier to create an integration. The problem with these packages is that you add another dependency (plus all the dependencies of the dependencies). This adds more and more code, which has to be loaded, can introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, and so on. Instead, use the built-in module:\n\n```typescript\n// If no auth needed\nconst response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);\n\n// If auth needed\nconst response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call(\n\tthis, \n\t'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi\n\toptions,\n);\n```\n\nThis uses the npm package [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\nRefer to [HTTP helpers](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/http-helpers/) for more information, and for migration instructions for the removed `this.helpers.request`.",

If you're using an authentication method that sends data in the header, body, or query string, set this to `'generic'`. \n\n#### `properties`\n\nObject. Defines the authentication methods. Options are:\n\n* `body`: Object. Sends authentication data in the request body. Can contain nested objects.\n```typescript\nauthenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {\n\ttype: 'generic',\n\tproperties: {\n\t\tbody: {\n\t\t\tusername: '={{$credentials.username}}',\n\t\t\tpassword: '={{$credentials.password}}',\n\t\t},\n\t},\n};\n``` \n\n* `header`: Object. Send authentication data in the request header.\n```typescript\nauthenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {\n\ttype: 'generic',\n\tproperties: {\n\t\theader: {\n\t\t\tAuthorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.authToken}}',\n\t\t},\n\t},\n};\n``` \n\n* `qs`: Object.

The other fields are optional. The default method is `GET`.\n\nSome notes about the possible fields:\n\n- `body`: you can use a regular JavaScript object for JSON payload, a buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for `multipart/form-data`, and `URLSearchParams` for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n- `headers`: a key-value pair.  \n\t* If `body` is an instance of `FormData` then n8n adds `content-type: multipart/form-data` automatically.  \n\t* If `body` is an instance of `URLSearchParams`, then n8n adds `content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.  \n\t* To override this behavior, set a `content-type` header.\n- `arrayFormat`: if your query string contains an array of data, such as `const qs = {IDs: [15,17]}`, the value of `arrayFormat` defines how n8n formats it.  \n\t* `indices` (default):  `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[0]=b&a[1]=c`  \n\t* `brackets`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[]=b&a[]=c`  \n\t* `repeat`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b&a=c`  \n\t* `comma`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b,c`\n- `auth`: Used for Basic auth. Provide `username` and `password`. n8n recommends omitting this, and using `helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication(...)` instead.\n- `disableFollowRedirect`: By default, n8n follows redirects. You can set this to true to prevent this from happening.\n- `skipSslCertificateValidation`: Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate\n- `returnFullResponse`: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: `{body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'}`\n- `encoding`: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify `arrayBuffer` to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.\n\n## Example\n\nFor an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost/v1/MattermostV1.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n## Deprecation of the previous helper\n\nThe previous helper implementation using `this.helpers.request(options)` used and exposed the `request-promise` library. This was removed in version 1.\n\nTo minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called `Axios`.\n\nIf you are having issues, please report them in the [Community Forums](https://community.n8n.io/){:target=_blank .external-link} or on [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n## Migration guide to the new helper\n\nThe new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use.\n\nNew nodes should all use the new helper. You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating:\n\n- Accepts `url`. Doesn't accept `uri`.\n- `encoding: null` now must be `encoding: arrayBuffer`.\n- `rejectUnauthorized: false` is now `skipSslCertificateValidation: true`\n- Use `body` according to `content-type` headers to clarify the payload.\n- `resolveWithFullResponse` is now `returnFullResponse` and has similar behavior",

This file is the JSON file at the root of your node. For example, the [`HttpBin.node.json`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/nodes/HttpBin/HttpBin.node.json){:target=_blank .external-class} file in the n8n starter. \n\nThe codex filename must match the node base filename.

    "node-file-structure.md": "---\n#https://www.notion.so/n8n/Frontmatter-432c2b8dff1f43d4b1c8d20075510fe4\ncontentType: explanation\n---\n\n# Node file structure\n\nFollowing best practices and standards in your node structure makes your node easier to maintain. It's helpful if other people need to work with the code.\n\nThe file and directory structure of your node depends on:\n\n* Your node's complexity.\n* Whether you use node versioning.\n* How many nodes you include in the npm package.\n\n## Required files and directories\n\nYour node must include:\n\n* A `package.json` file at the root of the project. This is required for any npm module.\n* A `nodes` directory, containing the code for your node:\n    * This directory must contain the [base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/), in the format `<node-name>.node.ts`. For example, `MyNode.node.ts`.\n    * n8n recommends including a [codex file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/), containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex name is `MyNode.node.json`.\n    * The `nodes` directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.\n* A `credentials` directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single [credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/). The filename format is `<node-name>.credentials.ts`. For example, `MyNode.credentials.ts`.\n\n## Modular structure\n<!-- vale off -->\nYou can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out.\n<!-- vale on -->\n\nA basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the [HttpBin starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/tree/master/nodes/HttpBin){:target=_blank .external-link} for an example of this.\n\nFor more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable){:target=_blank .external-class} or [Microsoft Outlook node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Microsoft/Outlook){:target=_blank .external-link} as examples. \n\n  * `actions`: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources.\n    * Each sub-directory should contain two types of files: \n      * An index file with resource description (named either `<resourceName>.resource.ts` or `index.ts`) \n      * Files for operations `<operationName>.operation.ts`. These files should have two exports: `description` of the operation and an `execute` function.\n  * `methods`: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions.  \n  * `transport`: a directory containing the communication implementation.\n\n\n## Versioning\n\nIf your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning.\n\n## Decide how many nodes to include in a package\n\nThere are two possible setups when building a node:\n\n* One node in one npm package.\n* More than one node in a single npm package.\n\nn8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the `nodes` directory.\n\n## A best-practice example for programmatic nodes\n\nn8n's built-in [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable){:target=_blank .external-class} implements a modular structure and versioning, following recommended patterns.",

You can make changes to existing nodes without breaking the existing behavior by introducing a new version.\n\nBe aware of how n8n decides which node version to load:\n\n* If a user builds and saves a workflow using version 1, n8n continues to use version 1 in that workflow, even if you create and publish a version 2 of the node.\n* When a user creates a new workflow and browses for nodes, n8n always loads the latest version of the node.\n\n/// note | Versioning type restricted by node style\nIf you build a node using the declarative style, you can't use full versioning.\n///\n## Light versioning\n\nThis is available for all node types.\n\nOne node can contain more than one version, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature: \n\n1. Change the main `version` parameter to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. \n2. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` in any object (to control which versions n8n displays the object with). You can also query the version from a function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.\n\nAs an example, say you want to add versioning to the NasaPics node from the [Declarative node tutorial](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/), then configure a resource so that n8n only displays it in version 2 of the node. In your base `NasaPics.node.ts` file:\n\n```js\n{\n    displayName: 'NASA Pics',\n    name: 'NasaPics',\n    icon: 'file:nasapics.svg',\n    // List the available versions\n    version: [1,2,3],\n    // More basic parameters here\n    properties: [\n        // Add a resource that's only displayed for version2\n        {\n            displayName: 'Resource name',\n            // More resource parameters\n            displayOptions: {\n                show: {\n                    '@version': 2,\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    ],\n}\n```\n\n## Full versioning\n\nThis isn't available for declarative-style nodes.\n\nAs an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\nFull versioning summary:\n\n- The base node file should extend `NodeVersionedType` instead of `INodeType`.\n- The base node file should contain a description including the `defaultVersion` (usually the latest), other basic node metadata such as name, and a list of versions. It shouldn't contain any node functionality.\n- n8n recommends using `v1`, `v2`, and so on, for version folder names.",

A common pattern is to use a Set node before the node that sends data, to convert the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node, rather than using a Set node. The resource mapper component can also validate input data against the schema provided in the node, and cast input data into the expected type.\n\n/// note | Mapping and matching\nMapping is the process of setting the input data to use as values when updating row(s). Matching is the process of using column names to identify the row(s) to update. \n///\t\n\n```js\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Columns',\n\tname: 'columns', // The name used to reference the element UI within the code\n\ttype: 'resourceMapper', // The UI element type\n\tdefault: {\n\t\t// mappingMode can be defined in the component (mappingMode: 'defineBelow')\n\t\t// or you can attempt automatic mapping (mappingMode: 'autoMapInputData')\n\t\tmappingMode: 'defineBelow',\n\t\t// Important: always set default value to null\n\t\tvalue: null,\n\t},\n\trequired: true,\n\t// See \"Resource mapper type options interface\" below for the full typeOptions specification\n\ttypeOptions: {\n\t\tresourceMapper: {\n\t\t\tresourceMapperMethod: 'getMappingColumns',\n\t\t\tmode: 'update',\n\t\t\tfieldWords: {\n\t\t\t\tsingular: 'column',\n\t\t\t\tplural: 'columns',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\taddAllFields: true, \n\t\t\tmultiKeyMatch: true,\n\t\t\tsupportAutoMap: true,\n\t\t\tmatchingFieldsLabels: {\n\t\t\t\ttitle: 'Custom matching columns title',\n\t\t\t\tdescription: 'Help text for custom matching columns',\n\t\t\t\thint: 'Below-field hint for custom matching columns',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t},\n},\n```\n\nRefer to the [Postgres node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2){:target=_blank .external-link} for a live example using a database schema.\n\nRefer to the [Google Sheets node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2){:target=_blank .external-link} for a live example using a schema-less service.\n\n### Resource mapper type options interface\n\nThe `typeOptions` section must implement the following interface:\n\n```js\nexport interface ResourceMapperTypeOptions {\n\t// The name of the method where you fetch the schema\n\t// Refer to the Resource mapper method section for more detail\n\tresourceMapperMethod: string;\n\t// Choose the mode for your operation\n\t// Supported modes: add, update, upsert\n\tmode: 'add' | 'update' | 'upsert';\n\t// Specify labels for fields in the UI\n\tfieldWords?: { singular: string; plural: string };\n\t// Whether n8n should display a UI input for every field when node first added to workflow\n\t// Default is true\n\taddAllFields?: boolean;\n\t// Specify a message to show if no fields are fetched from the service \n\t// (the call is successful but the response is empty)\n\tnoFieldsError?: string;\n\t// Whether to support multi-key column matching\n\t// multiKeyMatch is for update and upsert only\n\t// Default is false\n\t// If true, the node displays a multi-select dropdown for the matching column selector\n\tmultiKeyMatch?: boolean;\n\t// Whether to support automatic mapping\n\t// If false, n8n hides the mapping mode selector field and sets mappingMode to defineBelow\n\tsupportAutoMap?: boolean;\n\t// Custom labels for the matching columns selector\n\tmatchingFieldsLabels?: {\n\t\ttitle?: string;\n\t\tdescription?: string;\n\t\thint?: string;\n\t};\n}\n```\n\n### Resource mapper method\n\nThis method contains your node-specific logic for fetching the data schema.

As it relies on the node output data, you can't display this type of hint until after execution.\n\n```ts\nif (operation === 'select' && items.length > 1 && !node.executeOnce) {\n    // Expects two parameters: NodeExecutionData and an array of hints\n\treturn new NodeExecutionOutput(\n\t\t[returnData],\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tmessage: `This node ran ${items.length} times, once for each input item.

Refer to [Programmatic-style execute method](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-execute-method/) for more information.\n\nRefer to [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/) for parameters available to all nodes.\n\n## `defaultVersion`\n\n_Number_ | _Optional_\n\nUse `defaultVersion` when using the full versioning approach.\n\nn8n support two methods of node versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information.\n\n## `methods` and `loadOptions`\n\n_Object_ | _Optional_\n\nContains the `loadOptions` method for programmatic-style nodes. You can use this method to query the service to get user-specific settings (such as getting a user's email labels from Gmail), then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries.\n\nFor example, n8n's [Gmail node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Gmail/Gmail.node.ts) uses `loadOptions` to get all email labels:\n\n```js\n\tmethods = {\n\t\tloadOptions: {\n\t\t\t// Get all the labels and display them\n\t\t\tasync getLabels(\n\t\t\t\tthis: ILoadOptionsFunctions,\n\t\t\t): Promise<INodePropertyOptions[]> {\n\t\t\t\tconst returnData: INodePropertyOptions[] = [];\n\t\t\t\tconst labels = await googleApiRequestAllItems.call(\n\t\t\t\t\tthis,\n\t\t\t\t\t'labels',\n\t\t\t\t\t'GET',\n\t\t\t\t\t'/gmail/v1/users/me/labels',\n\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t\tfor (const label of labels) {\n\t\t\t\t\tconst labelName = label.name;\n\t\t\t\t\tconst labelId = label.id;\n\t\t\t\t\treturnData.push({\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname: labelName,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: labelId,\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\treturn returnData;\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t};\n```\n\n## `version`\n\n_Number_ or _Array_ | _Optional_\n\nUse `version` when using the light versioning approach.\n\nIf you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support multiple versions, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.\n\nn8n support two methods of node versioning. Programmatic-style nodes can use either. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information.",

They're the same for all node types.\n\n## `displayName`\n\n_String_ | _Required_\n\nThis is the name users see in the n8n GUI.\n\n## `name`\n\n_String_ | _Required_\n\nThe internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.\n\n## `icon`\n\n_String_ or _Object_ | _Required_\n\nSpecifies an icon for a particular node. n8n recommends uploading your own image file. \n\nYou can provide the icon file name as a string, or as an object to handle different icons for light and dark modes.\nIf the icon works in both light and dark modes, use a string that starts with `file:`, indicating the path to the icon file. For example:\n\n```\nicon: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg'\n```\nTo provide different icons for light and dark modes, use an object with `light` and `dark` properties. For example:\n```\nicon: { \n  light: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg', \n  dark: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.dark.svg' \n}\n```\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/node-icons.md\"\n\n## `group`\n\n_Array of strings_ | _Required_\n\nTells n8n how the node behaves when the workflow runs. Options are:\n\n* `trigger`: node waits for a trigger.\n* `schedule`: node waits for a timer to expire.\n* `input`, `output`, `transform`: these currently have no effect.\n* An empty array, `[]`. Use this as the default option if you don't need `trigger` or `schedule`.\n\n## `description`\n\n_String_ | _Required_\n\nA short description of the node. n8n uses this in the GUI.\n\n## `defaults`\n\n_Object_ | _Required_\n\nContains essential brand and name settings.\n\nThe object can include:\n\n* `name`: String. Used as the node name on the canvas if the `displayName` is too long.\n* `color`: String. Hex color code. Provide the brand color of the integration for use in n8n.\n\n## `forceInputNodeExecution`\n\n_Boolean_ | _Optional_\n\nWhen building a multi-input node, you can choose to force all preceding nodes on all branches to execute before the node runs. The default is `false` (requiring only one input branch to run).\n\n## `inputs`\n\n_Array of strings_ | _Required_\n\nNames the input connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the input side. If you need only one connector, use `input: ['main']`.\n\n\n## `outputs`\n\n_Array of strings_ | _Required_  \n\nNames the output connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the output side. If you need only one connector, use `output: ['main']`.\n\n## `requiredInputs`\n\n_Integer_ or _Array_ | _Optional_\n\nUsed for multi-input nodes. Specify inputs by number that must have data (their branches must run) before the node can execute.\n\n## `credentials`\n\n_Array of objects_ | _Required_  \n\nThis parameter tells n8n the credential options. Each object defines an authentication type.\n\nThe object must include:\n\n* `name`: the credential name. Must match the `name` property in the credential file. For example, `name: 'asanaApi'`  in [`Asana.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Asana/Asana.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-class} links to `name = 'asanaApi'` in [`AsanaApi.credential.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts){:target=_blank .external-class}.\n* `required`: Boolean. Specify whether authentication is required to use this node.\n\n## `requestDefaults`\n\n_Object_ | _Required_  \n\nSet up the basic information for the API calls the node makes.\n\nThis object must include:\n\n* `baseURL`: The API base URL.\n\nYou can also add:\n\n* `headers`: an object describing the API call headers, such as content type.\n* `url`: string. Appended to the `baseURL`. You can usually leave this out. It's more common to provide this in the `operations`.\n\n## `properties`\n\n_Array of objects_ | _Required_  \n\nThis contains the resource and operations objects that define node behaviors, as well as objects to set up mandatory and optional fields that can receive user input.\n\n### Resource objects\n\nA resource object includes the following parameters:\n\n* `displayName`: String. This should always be `Resource`.\n* `name`: String. This should always be `resource`.\n* `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.\n* `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `resource`. \n\n### Operations objects\n\nThe operations object defines the available operations on a resource.\n\n* `displayName`: String. This should always be `Options`.\n* `name`: String. This should always be `option`.\n* `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `dateTime` results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.\n* `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `operation`.\n* `options`: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An `options` object includes:\n\t* `name`. String.\n\t* `value`. String.\n\t* `action`: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called `\"Card\"` and an operation `\"Get all\"`, your action is `\"Get all cards\"`.\n\t* `description`: String.\n\t* `routing`: Object containing request details.\n\n### Additional fields objects\n\nThese objects define optional parameters. n8n displays them under **Additional Fields** in the GUI. Users can choose which parameters to set.\n\nThe objects must include:\n\n```js\ndisplayName: 'Additional Fields',\nname: 'additionalFields',\n// The UI element type\ntype: ''\nplaceholder: 'Add Field',\ndefault: {},\ndisplayOptions: {\n  // Set which resources and operations this field is available for\n  show: {\n    resource: [\n      // Resource names\n    ],\n    operation: [\n      // Operation names\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nFor more information about UI element types, refer to [UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/).",

This is useful for nodes that you create for internal use only at your company.\n\n## Install your node in a Docker n8n instance\n\nIf you're running n8n using Docker, you need to create a Docker image with the node installed in n8n. \n\n1. Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile).\n\n\tYour Dockerfile should look like this:\n\n\t```Dockerfile\n\tFROM node:16-alpine\n\n\tARG N8N_VERSION\n\n\tRUN if [ -z \"$N8N_VERSION\" ] ; then echo \"The N8N_VERSION argument is missing!\" ; exit 1; fi\n\n\t# Update everything and install needed dependencies\n\tRUN apk add --update graphicsmagick tzdata git tini su-exec\n\n\t# Set a custom user to not have n8n run as root\n\tUSER root\n\n\t# Install n8n and the packages it needs to build it correctly.\n\tRUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies python3 build-base ca-certificates && \\\n\t\tnpm config set python \"$(which python3)\" && \\\n\t\tnpm_config_user=root npm install -g full-icu n8n@${N8N_VERSION} && \\\n\t\tapk del build-dependencies \\\n\t\t&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root;\n\n\n\t# Install fonts\n\tRUN apk --no-cache add --virtual fonts msttcorefonts-installer fontconfig && \\\n\t\tupdate-ms-fonts && \\\n\t\tfc-cache -f && \\\n\t\tapk del fonts && \\\n\t\tfind  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/ -type l -exec unlink {} \\; \\\n\t\t&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root\n\n\tENV NODE_ICU_DATA /usr/local/lib/node_modules/full-icu\n\n\tWORKDIR /data\n\n\tCOPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh\n\tENTRYPOINT [\"tini\", \"--\", \"/docker-entrypoint.sh\"]\n\n\tEXPOSE 5678/tcp\n\t```\n\n2. Compile your custom node code (`npm run build` if you are using nodes starter). Copy the **node** and **credential** folders from within the **dist** folder into your container's `~/.n8n/custom/` directory. This makes them available to Docker.\n\n3. Download the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/docker-entrypoint.sh) file, and place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile.\n\n4.

This style:\n\n* Uses a JSON-based syntax, making it simpler to write, with less risk of introducing bugs.\n* Is more future-proof.\n* Supports integration with REST APIs.\n\nThe programmatic style is more verbose. You must use the programmatic style for:\n\n* Trigger nodes\n* Any node that isn't REST-based. This includes nodes that need to call a GraphQL API and nodes that use external dependencies.\n* Any node that needs to transform incoming data.\n* Full versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information on types of versioning.\n\n## Data handling differences\n\nThe main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `operations` object. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information on node parameters and the `execute()` method.\n\n## Syntax differences\n\nTo understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below. This example creates a simplified version of the SendGrid integration, called \"FriendGrid.\" The following code snippets aren't complete: they emphasize the differences in the node building styles.\n\nIn programmatic style:\n\n```js\nimport {\n\tIExecuteFunctions,\n\tINodeExecutionData,\n\tINodeType,\n\tINodeTypeDescription,\n\tIRequestOptions,\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\n// Create the FriendGrid class\nexport class FriendGrid implements INodeType {\n  description: INodeTypeDescription = {\n    displayName: 'FriendGrid',\n    name: 'friendGrid',\n    . . .\n    properties: [\n      {\n        displayName: 'Resource',\n        . . .\n      },\n      {\n      displayName: 'Operation',\n      name: 'operation',\n      type: 'options',\n      displayOptions: {\n        show: {\n            resource: [\n            'contact',\n            ],\n        },\n      },\n      options: [\n        {\n          name: 'Create',\n          value: 'create',\n          description: 'Create a contact',\n        },\n      ],\n      default: 'create',\n      description: 'The operation to perform.',\n    },\n    {\n      displayName: 'Email',\n      name: 'email',\n      . . .\n    },\n    {\n      displayName: 'Additional Fields',\n      // Sets up optional fields\n    },\n  ],\n};\n\n  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {\n    let responseData;\n    const resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string;\n    const operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string;\n    //Get credentials the user provided for this node\n    const credentials = await this.getCredentials('friendGridApi') as IDataObject;\n\n    if (resource === 'contact') {\n      if (operation === 'create') {\n      // Get email input\n      const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', 0) as string;\n      // Get additional fields input\n      const additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', 0) as IDataObject;\n      const data: IDataObject = {\n          email,\n      };\n\n      Object.assign(data, additionalFields);\n\n      // Make HTTP request as defined in https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/\n      const options: IRequestOptions = {\n        headers: {\n            'Accept': 'application/json',\n            'Authorization': `Bearer ${credentials.apiKey}`,\n        },\n        method: 'PUT',\n        body: {\n            contacts: [\n            data,\n            ],\n        },\n        url: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`,\n        json: true,\n      };\n      responseData = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);\n      }\n    }\n    // Map data to n8n data\n    return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(responseData)];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn declarative style:\n\n```js\nimport { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';\n\n// Create the FriendGrid class\nexport class FriendGrid implements INodeType {\n  description: INodeTypeDescription = {\n    displayName: 'FriendGrid',\n    name: 'friendGrid',\n    . . .\n    // Set up the basic request configuration\n    requestDefaults: {\n        baseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing'\n    },\n    properties: [\n        {\n        displayName: 'Resource',\n        . . .\n        },\n        {\n        displayName: 'Operation',\n        name: 'operation',\n        type: 'options',\n        displayOptions: {\n          show: {\n            resource: [\n                'contact',\n            ],\n          },\n        },\n        options: [\n          {\n            name: 'Create',\n            value: 'create',\n            description: 'Create a contact',\n            // Add the routing object\n            routing: {\n                request: {\n                method: 'POST',\n                url: '=/contacts',\n                send: {\n                    type: 'body',\n                    properties: {\n                    email: {{$parameter[\"email\"]}}\n                    }\n                }\n                }\n            },\n            // Handle the response to contact creation\n            output: {\n                postReceive: [\n                {\n                    type: 'set',\n                    properties: {\n                    value: '={{ { \"success\": $response } }}'\n                    }\n                }\n                ]\n            }\n            },\n        ],\n        default: 'create',\n        description: 'The operation to perform.',\n        },\n        {\n        displayName: 'Email',\n        . . .\n        },\n        {\n        displayName: 'Additional Fields',\n        // Sets up optional fields\n        },\n    ],\n  }\n  // No execute method needed\n}\n```",

Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience.\n\nThis document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes.\n\n## Design guidance\n\nAll node's use n8n's [node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/), so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process:\n\n* Review the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself:\n    * What can you leave out? \n    * What can you simplify?\n    * Which parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them?\n* Use a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on [showing and hiding fields](#showing-and-hiding-fields).\n\n## Standards\n\n### UI text style\n\n| Element | Style |\n| ------- | ----- |\n| Drop-down value | Title case |\n| Hint | Sentence case |\n| Info box | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence information. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |\n| Node name | Title case |\n| Parameter name | Title case |\n| Subtitle | Title case |\n| Tooltip | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence tooltips. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |\n\n### UI text terminology\n\n* Use the same terminology as the service the node connects to. For example, a Notion node should refer to Notion blocks, not Notion paragraphs, because Notion calls these elements blocks. There are exceptions to this rule, usually to avoid technical terms (for example, refer to the guidance on [name and description for upsert operations](#upsert-operations)).\n* Sometimes a service has different terms for something in its API and in its GUI. Use the GUI language in your node, as this is what most users are familiar with. If you think some users may need to refer to the service's API docs, consider including this information in a hint.\n* Don't use technical jargon when there are simpler alternatives.\n* Be consistent when naming things. For example, choose one of `directory` or `folder` then stick to it. \n\n### Node naming conventions\n\n| Convention | Correct | Incorrect |\n| ---------- | ------- | --------- |\n| If a node is a trigger node, <br>the displayed name should have 'Trigger' at the end, <br>with a space before. | Shopify Trigger | ShopifyTrigger, Shopify trigger |\n| Don't include 'node' in the name. | Asana | Asana Node, Asana node |\n\n### Showing and hiding fields\n\nFields can either be:\n\n* Displayed when the node opens: use this for resources and operations, and required fields.\n* Hidden in the **Optional fields** section until a user clicks on that section: use this for optional fields.\n\nProgressively disclose complexity: hide a field until any earlier fields it depends on have values. For example, if you have a **Filter by date** toggle, and a **Date to filter by** datepicker, don't display **Date to filter by** until the user enables **Filter by date**.\n\n\n### Conventions by field type\n\n#### Credentials\n\nn8n automatically displays credential fields as the top fields in the node.\n\n#### Resources and operations\n\nAPIs usually involve doing something to data. For example, \"get all tasks.\" In this example, \"task\" is the resource, and \"get all\" is the operation.\n\nWhen your node has this resource and operation pattern, your first field should be **Resource**, and your second field should be **Operation**.\n\n#### Required fields\n\nOrder fields by:\n\n* Most important to least important.\n* Scope: from broad to narrow. For example, you have fields for **Document**, **Page**, and **Text to insert**, put them in that order.\n\n#### Optional fields\n\n* Order fields alphabetically. To group similar things together, you can rename them. For example, rename **Email** and **Secondary Email** to **Email (primary)** and **Email (secondary)**.\n* If an optional field has a default value that the node uses when the value isn't set, load the field with that value. Explain this in the field description. For example, **Defaults to false**.\n* Connected fields: if one optional fields is dependent on another, bundle them together. They should both be under a single option that shows both fields when selected.\n* If you have a lot of optional fields, consider grouping them by theme.\n\n#### Help\n\nThere are five types of help built in to the GUI:\n\n* Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to [UI elements | Notice](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#notice) for more information.\n  * Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention.\n* Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive.\n* Node hints: provide help in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. Refer to [UI elements | Hints](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#hints) for more information.\n* Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon ![\"Screenshot of the tooltip icon. The icon is a ? in a grey circle\"](/_images/common-icons/help-tooltip.png). Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need.\n  * You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information. \n  * When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it.\n* Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field.\n\nInfo boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information.\n\n#### Errors\n\nMake it clear which fields are required.\n\nAdd validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email.\n\nWhen displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in **Details**.\n\n#### Toggles\n\n* Tooltips for binary states should start with something like **Whether to . . . **.\n* You may need a list rather than a toggle:\n    * Use toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, **Simplify Output?**. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.\n    * Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, **Append?**. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).\n\n#### Lists\n\n* Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.\n* Sort list options alphabetically.\n* You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.\n* If there is an option like **All**, use the word **All**, not shorthand like *****.\n\n#### Trigger node inputs\n\nWhen a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:\n\n* Name the parameter **Trigger on**.\n* Don't include a tooltip.\n\n#### Subtitles\n\nSet subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:\n\n```js\nsubtitle: '={{$parameter[\"operation\"] + \": \" + $parameter[\"resource\"]}}',\n```\n\n#### IDs\n\nWhen performing an operation on a specific record, such as \"update a task comment\" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.\n\n* Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:\n    * By choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the `loadOptions` parameter. Refer to [Base files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information.\n    * By entering an ID.\n* Name the field `<Record name> name or ID`. For example, **Workspace Name or ID**. Add a tooltip saying \"Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression.\" Link to n8n's [Expressions](/code/expressions/) documentation.\n* Build your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example:\n    * If you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path.\n    * If the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL.\n\n#### Dates and timestamps\n\nn8n uses [ISO timestamp strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601){:target=_blank class=.external-link} for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.\n\n#### JSON\n\nYou should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:\n\n* Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.\n* Using an expression that returns JSON.\n\n\n\n#### Node icons\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/node-icons.md\"\n\n\n### Common patterns and exceptions\n\nThis section provides guidance on handling common design patterns, including some edge cases and exceptions to the main standards.\n\n#### Simplify responses\n\nAPIs can return a lot of data that isn't useful. Consider adding a toggle that allows users to choose to simplify the response data:\n\n  * Name: **Simplify Response**\n  * Description: **Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data**\n\n#### Upsert operations\n\nThis should always be a separate operation with:\n\n  * Name: **Create or Update**\n  * Description: **Create a new record, or update the current one if it already exists (upsert)**\n\n#### Boolean operators\n<!-- vale off -->\nn8n doesn't have good support for combining boolean operators, such as AND and OR, in the GUI. Whenever possible, provide options for all ANDs or all ORs.\n<!-- vale on -->\n\nFor example, you have a field called **Must match** to test if values match. Include options to test for **Any** and **All**, as separate options.\n\n#### Source keys or binary properties\n\nBinary data is file data, such as spreadsheets or images. In n8n, you need a named key to reference the data. Don't use the terms \"binary data\" or \"binary property\" for this field. Instead, use a more descriptive name: **Input data field name** / **Output data field name**.",

The linter detects issues and automatically fixes them to help you follow best practices.\n\n`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base` contains a [collection of rules](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset) for node files (`*.node.ts`), resource description files (`*Description.ts`), credential files (`*.credentials.ts`), and the `package.json` of a community package.\n\n## Setup\n\nIf using the [n8n node starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter): Run `npm install` in the starter project to install all dependencies. Once the installation finishes, the linter is available to you. \n\nIf using VS Code, install the [ESLint VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.VS Code-eslint). For other IDEs, refer to their ESLint integrations.\n\n/// note | Don't edit the configuration file\n[`.eslintrc.js`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) contains the configuration for `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`. Don't edit this file.\n///\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use the linter in a community package or in the main n8n repository.\n\n### Linting\n\nIn a community package, the linter runs automatically after installing dependencies and before publishing the package to npm. In the [main n8n repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n){:target=_blank .external-link}, the linter runs automatically using GitHub Actions whenever you push to your pull request.\n\nIn both cases, VS Code lints in the background as you work on your project. Hover over a detected issue to see a full description of the linting and a link to further information.\n\nYou can also run the linter manually:\n\n* Run `npm run lint` to lint and view detected issues in your console. \n* Run `npm run lintfix` to lint and automatically fix issues. The linter fixes violations of rules [marked as automatically fixable](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset).\n\nBoth commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in `/packages/nodes-base/` in the main repository.\n\n### Exceptions\n\nInstead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it.\n\nTo make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on `Quick fix` (or `cmd+.` in macOS) and select **Disable {rule} for this line**. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please [report it in the linter repository](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base/issues).\n\nTo add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the [TSLint documentation](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/) for more guidance.",

If this happens, the instance can crash and become inaccessible.\n* Data storage: depending on your execution settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage. \n\nTo avoid these issues, n8n recommends that you build your workflows with memory efficiency in mind, and don't save unnecessary data\n\n## Memory limits on each Cloud plan\n\nCurrent plans:\n\n* Trial: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\n* Starter: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\n* Pro-1 (10k executions): 640MiB RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable\n* Pro-2 (50k executions): 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\n* Enterprise: 4096MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\n\nLegacy plans:\n\n* Start: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\n* Power: 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\n\nn8n gives each instance up to 100GB of data storage.\n\n## How to reduce memory consumption in your workflow\n\nThe way you build workflows affects how much data they consume when executed. Although these guidelines aren't applicable to all cases, they provide a baseline of best practices to avoid exceeding instance memory.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/self-hosting/scaling/reduce-memory-consumption.md\"\n\nNote that n8n itself consumes memory to run. On average, the software alone uses around 180MiB RAM.\n\nInteractions with the UI also consume memory. Playing around with the workflow UI while it performs heavy executions could also push the memory capacity over the limit.\n\n## How to manage execution data on Cloud\n\nExecution data includes node data, parameters, variables, execution context, and binary data references. It's text-based.\n\nBinary data is non-textual data that n8n can't represent as plain text. This is files and media such as images, documents, audio files, and videos. It's much larger than textual data.\n\nIf a workflow consumes a large amounts of data and is past testing stage, it's a good option to stop saving the successful executions.\n\nThere are two ways you can control how much execution data n8n stores in the database:\n\nIn the admin dashboard:\n\n1. From your workspace or editor, navigate to **Admin Panel**.\n1. Select **Manage**.\n1. In **Executions to Save** deselect the executions you don't want to log.\n\nIn your workflow settings:\n\n1. Select the **Options** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Options menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> menu.\n1. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.\n1. Change **Save successful production executions** to **Do not save**.\n\n## Cloud data pruning and out of memory incident prevention\n\n### Automatic data pruning\n\nn8n automatically prunes execution logs after a certain time or once you reach the max storage limit, whichever comes first. The pruning always happens from oldest to newest and the limits depend on your Could plan:\n\n* Start and Starter plans: max 2500 executions saved and 7 days execution log retention;\n* Pro and Power plans: max 25000 executions saved and 30 days execution log retention;\n* Enterprise plan: max 50000 executions saved and unlimited execution log retention time.\n\n### Manual data pruning\n\nHeavier executions and use cases can exceed database capacity despite the automatic pruning practices. In cases like this, n8n will manually prune data to protect instance stability.\n\n1. An alert system warns n8n if an instance is at 85% disk capacity.\n2. n8n prunes execution data. n8n does this by running a backup of the instance (workflows, users, credentials and execution data) and restoring it without execution data.\n \t\n\nDue to the human steps in this process, the alert system isn't perfect. If warnings are triggered after hours or if data consumption rates are high, there might not be time to prune the data before the remaining disk space fills up.",

Read [self-hosted n8n concurrency control](/hosting/scaling/concurrency-control/) to learn how concurrency works with self-hosted n8n instances.\n///\n\nToo many concurrent executions can cause performance degradation and unresponsiveness. To prevent this and improve instance stability, n8n sets concurrency limits for production executions in regular mode.\n\nAny executions beyond the limits queue for later processing. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order.\n\n## Concurrency limits\n\nn8n limits the number of concurrent executions for Cloud instances according to their plan:\n\n* Starter and Trial: 5\n* Pro (10k workflow executions, 15 active workflows): 20\n* Pro (50k workflow executions, 50 active workflows): 50\n* Enterprise (in regular mode): 200\n\nYou can view the number of active executions and your plan's concurrency limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab.\n\n## Details\n\nSome other details about concurrency to keep in mind:\n\n- Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, or error executions.\n- You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.\n- On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.\n\n## Comparison to queue mode\n\n/// info | Feature availability\nQueue mode is available for Cloud Enterprise plans. To enable it, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n///\n\nConcurrency in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency in regular mode. In queue mode, the concurrency settings determine how many jobs each worker can run in parallel. In regular mode, concurrency limits apply to the entire instance.",

As a Processor, n8n implements policies and practices that secure the personal data you send to the platform, and includes a\u00a0[Data Processing Agreement](https://n8n.io/legal/#data){:target=_blank .external-link} as part of the company's standard\u00a0[Terms of Service](https://n8n.io/legal/#terms){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\nThe n8n Data Processing Agreement includes the\u00a0[Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Read about how n8n stores and processes this information in the [privacy policy](https://n8n.io/legal/#privacy){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\nThe data gathered is different in self-hosted n8n and n8n Cloud.\n\n### Data collection in self-hosted n8n\n\nn8n takes care to keep self-hosted data anonymous and avoids collecting sensitive data. \n\n#### What n8n collects\n\n- Error codes and messages of failed executions (excluding any payload data, and not for custom nodes)\n- Error reports for app crashes and API issues\n- The graph of a workflow (types of nodes used and how they're connected)\n- From node parameters:\n    - The 'resource' and 'operation' that a node is set to (if applicable)\n    - For HTTP request nodes, the domain, path, and method (with personal data anonymized)\n- Data around workflow executions:  \n    - Status\n    - The user ID of the user who ran the execution\n    - The first time a workflow loads data from an external source\n    - The first successful production (non-manual) workflow execution\n- The domain of webhook calls, if specified (excluding subdomain).\n- Details on how the UI is used (for example, navigation, nodes panel searches)\n- Diagnostic information:\n    - n8n version\n    - Selected settings:\n        - DB_TYPE\n        - N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED\n        - N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS\n        - [Execution variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/executions)\n    - OS, RAM, and CPUs\n    - Anonymous instance ID\n - IP address\n\n#### What n8n doesn't collect\n\nn8n doesn't collect private or sensitive information, such as:\n\n- Personally identifiable information (except IP address)\n- Credential information\n- Node parameters (except 'resource' and 'operation')\n- Execution data\n- Sensitive settings (for example, endpoints, ports, DB connections, username/password)\n- Error payloads\n\n#### How collection works\n\nMost data is sent to n8n as events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours).\n\n#### Opting out of telemetry\n\nTelemetry collection is enabled by default. To disable it you can configure the following environment variables.\n\nTo opt out of telemetry events:\n\n```bash\nexport N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false\n```\n\nTo opt out of checking for new versions of n8n:\n\n```bash\nexport N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false\n```\n\nSee [configuration](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more info on how to set environment variables.\n\n### Data collection in n8n Cloud\n\nn8n Cloud collects everything listed in [Data collection in self-hosted n8n](#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n).\n\nAdditionally, in n8n Cloud, n8n uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} to track events and visualise usage, including using session recordings. Session recordings comprise the data seen by a user on screen, with the exception of credential values. n8n's product team uses this data to improve the product. All recordings are deleted after 21 days.\n\n### AI in n8n\n\nTo provide enhanced assistance, n8n integrates AI-powered features that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\n#### How n8n uses AI\n\nTo assist and improve user experience, n8n may send specific context data to LLMs. This context data is strictly limited to information about the current workflow. n8n does not send any values from credential fields or actual output data to AI services. The data will not be incorporated, used, or retained to train the models of the AI services. Any data will be deleted after 30 days.\n\n#### When n8n shares data\n\nData is only sent to AI services if workspaces have opted in to use the assistant. The Assistant is enabled by default for n8n Cloud users. When a workspace opts in to use the assistant, node-specific data is transmitted only during direct interactions and active sessions with the AI assistant, ensuring no unnecessary data sharing occurs.\n\n#### What n8n shares\n\n- **General Workflow Information**: This includes details about which nodes are present in your workflow, the number of items currently in the workflow, and whether the workflow is active.\n- **Input & Output Schemas of Nodes**: This includes the schema of all nodes with incoming data and the output schema of a node in question. We do not send the actual data value of the schema.\n- **Node Configuration**: This includes the operations, options, and settings chosen in the referenced node.\n- **Code and Expressions**: This includes any code or expressions in the node in question to help with debugging potential issues and optimizations.\n\n#### What n8n doesn't share\n\n- **Credentials**: Any values of the credential fields of your nodes.\n- **Output Data**: The actual data processed by your workflows.\n- **Sensitive Information**: Any personally identifiable information or other sensitive data that could compromise your privacy or security that you have not explicitly mentioned in node parameters or your code of a [Code Node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).\n\n### Documentation telemetry\n\nn8n's documentation (this website) uses cookies to recognize your repeated visits and preferences, as well as to measure the effectiveness of n8n's documentation and whether users find what they're searching for. With your consent, you're helping n8n to make our documentation better.\n\n[Change cookie settings](#__consent){ .md-button }\n\n## Retention and deletion of personal identifiable data\n\nPID (personal identifiable data) is data that's personal to you and would identify you as an individual.\n\n### n8n Cloud\n\n#### PID retention\n\nn8n only retains data for as long as necessary to provide the core service. \n\nFor n8n Cloud, n8n stores your workflow code, credentials, and other data indefinitely, until you choose to delete it or close your account. The platform stores execution data according to\u00a0the retention rules on your account.\n\nn8n deletes most internal application logs and logs tied to subprocessors within 90 days. The company retains a subset of logs for longer periods where required for security investigations.\n\n#### PID deletion\n\nIf you choose to delete your n8n account, n8n deletes all customer data and event data associated with your account. n8n deletes customer data in backups within 90 days.\n\n### Self-hosted\n\nSelf-hosted users should have their own PID policy and data deletion processes. Refer to [What you can do](/privacy-security/what-you-can-do/) for more information.\n\n## Payment processor\n\nn8n uses\u00a0Paddle.com to process payments. When you sign up for a paid plan, Paddle transmits and stores the details of your payment method according to their security policy. n8n stores no information about your payment method.\n\n<!-- vale on -->",

Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes) for more information.\n* Choose to exclude certain nodes. For example, you can disable nodes like Execute Command or SSH.

This component is useful for node creators. If your node does insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. Often it's necessary to use a Set node before a node that sends data, to get the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node.\n\nRefer to [Node user interface elements | Resource mapper](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#resource-mapper) for guidance for node builders.\n\n## n8n@0.230.3\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.230.2...n8n@0.230.3){:target=_blank .external-link} for this version.<br />\n**Release date:** 2023-06-05\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases){:target=_blank .external-link} on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@0.230.2\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.230.1...n8n@0.230.2){:target=_blank .external-link} for this version.<br />\n**Release date:** 2023-05-25\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases){:target=_blank .external-link} on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@0.230.1\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.230.0...n8n@0.230.1){:target=_blank .external-link} for this version.<br />\n**Release date:** 2023-05-25\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases){:target=_blank .external-link} on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@0.230.0\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.229.0...n8n@0.230.0){:target=_blank .external-link} for this version.<br />\n**Release date:** 2023-05-24\n\nThis release contains new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases){:target=_blank .external-link} on GitHub.\n\n### New nodes\n\n<div class=\"n8n-new-features\" markdown>\n\n#### Execution Data\n\nSave metadata for workflow executions.

You can now save [Custom execution data](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/), and use it to filter both the [All executions](/workflows/executions/all-executions/) and [Single workflow executions](/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/) lists.\n\n</div>\n\n\n* Add test overrides.\n* Core: Improve LDAP/SAML toggle and tests.\n* Core: Limit user invites when SAML is enabled.\n* Core: Make OAuth2 error handling consistent with success handling.\n* Editor: Fix ResourceLocator dropdown style.\n\n\n### New nodes\n\nThis release introduces the [Filter](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.filter/) node. The node allows you to filter items based on a condition. If the item meets the condition, the Filter node passes it on to the next node in the Filter node output.

This allows developers to build and share nodes as npm packages. Users can install community-built nodes directly in n8n.\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"n8n-new-features\" markdown>\n\n#### Data pinning\n\n[Data pinning](/data/data-pinning/) allows you to freeze and edit data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. This avoids repeated API calls when developing a workflow, reducing calls to external systems, and speeding up workflow development.\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"n8n-new-features\" markdown>\n\n#### Data mapping\n\nThis release introduces a drag and drop interface for [data mapping](/data/data-mapping/), as a quick way to map data without using expressions.\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"n8n-new-features\" markdown>\n\n#### Simplify authentication setup for node creators\n\nThis release introduces a simpler way of handling authorization when building a node. All credentials should now contain an `authenticate` property that dictates how the credential is used in a request.\nn8n has also simplified authentication types: instead of specifying an authentication type and using the correct interface, you can now set the type as `\"generic\"`, and use the `IAuthenticateGeneric` interface.\n\nYou can use this approach for any authentication method where data is sent in the header, body, or query string. This includes methods like bearer and basic auth. You can't use this approach for more complex authentication types that require multiple calls, or for methods that don't pass authentication data. This includes OAuth.\n\nFor an example of the new authentication syntax, refer to n8n's [Asana node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\n```js\n// in AsanaApi.credentials.ts\nimport {\n\tIAuthenticateGeneric,\n\tICredentialType,\n\tINodeProperties,\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\nexport class AsanaApi implements ICredentialType {\n\tname = 'asanaApi';\n\tdisplayName = 'Asana API';\n\tdocumentationUrl = 'asana';\n\tproperties: INodeProperties[] = [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tdisplayName: 'Access Token',\n\t\t\tname: 'accessToken',\n\t\t\ttype: 'string',\n\t\t\tdefault: '',\n\t\t},\n\t];\n\n\tauthenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {\n\t\ttype: 'generic',\n\t\tproperties: {\n\t\t\theaders: {\n\t\t\t\tAuthorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.accessToken}}',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t};\n}\n```\n</div>\n\n#### Other new features\n\n* Added a `preAuthentication` method to credentials.\n* Added more credentials tests.\n* Introduce automatic fixing for paired item information in some scenarios.\n\n### Node enhancements\n\n* [ERPNext node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.erpnext/): add credential tests, and add support for unauthorized certs.\n* [Google Drive node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/): add support for move to trash.\n* [Mindee node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mindee/): support new version.\n* [Notion node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/): support ignoring the Notion URL property if empty.\n* [Shopify node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.shopify/): add OAuth support.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n* API: add missing node settings parameters.\n* API: validate static data value for resource workflow.\n* Baserow Node: fix an issue preventing table names from loading.\n* Editor: hide the **Execute previous node** button when in read-only mode.\n* Editor: hide tabs if there's only one branch.\n* Roundup of link fixes in nodes.\n\n### Contributors\n\n\n[Florian Bachmann](https://github.com/baflo){:target=_blank .external-link}\n[Olivier Aygalenq](https://github.com/oaygalenq){:target=_blank .external-link}\n\n\n## n8n@0.186.1\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.186.0...n8n@0.186.1){:target=_blank .external-link} for this version.<br />\n**Release date:** 2022-07-14\n\nThis is a bug fix release.

You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.\n\nOne of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication.

To use this feature, change the `version` parameter in your node to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` (to control which version n8n displays). You can also query the version in your `execute` function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.\n\n</div>\n\n### Node enhancements\n\n* [Google Sheets node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/): n8n now handles header names formatted as JSON paths.\n* [Microsoft Dynamics CRM node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftdynamicscrm/): add support for regions other than North America.\n* [Telegram node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/): add support for querying chat administrators.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n* **core**: fixed an issue that was causing n8n to apply authentication checks, even when user management was disabled.\n* **core**: n8n now skips credentials checks for disabled nodes.\n* **editor**: fix a bug affecting touchscreen monitors.\n* [HubSpot node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspot/): fix for search operators.\n* [SendGrid node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendgrid/): fixed an issue with sending attachments.\n* [Wise node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wise/): respect the time parameter on `get: exchangeRate`.\n\n### Contributors\n\n\n[Jack Rudenko](https://github.com/erudenko)\n[MC Naveen](https://github.com/mcnaveen)\n[vcrwr](https://github.com/vcrwr)\n\n\n## n8n@0.174.0\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.173.1...n8n@0.174.0) for this version.<br />\n**Release date:** 2022-04-25\n\n### New features\n\n<div class=\"n8n-new-features\" markdown>\n\n#### Sticky Notes\n\nThis release adds Sticky Notes, a new feature that allows you to annotate and comment on your workflows.

You'll create two environments: development and production. It uses GitHub as the Git provider. The process is similar for other providers. \n\nn8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. You link an n8n instance to a Git branch, and use a push-pull pattern to move work between environments. You should have some understanding of environments and Git. If you need more information on these topics, refer to:\n\n* [Environments in n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/environments/): the purpose of environments, and how they work in n8n. \n* [Git and n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/git/): Git concepts and source control in n8n.\n\n## Choose your source control pattern\n\nBefore setting up source control and environments, you need to plan your environments, and how they relate to Git branches. n8n supports different [Branch patterns](/source-control-environments/understand/patterns/). For environments, you need to choose between two patterns: multi-instance, multi-branch, or multi-instance, single-branch. This tutorial covers both patterns.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/one-direction.md\"\n\n### Multiple instances, multiple branches\n\n![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/multi-instance-multi-branch-pros-cons.md\"\n\n\n### Multiple instances, one branch\n\n![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/multi-instance-one-branch-pros-cons.md\"\n\n## Set up your repository\n\nOnce you've chosen your pattern, you need to set up your GitHub repository.\n\n=== \"Multi-branch\"\n\n    1. [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository){:target=_blank .external-link}. \n\t    * Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.\n\t    * Create the new repository with a README so you can immediately create branches. \n    1. Create one branch named `production` and another named `development`. Refer to [Creating and deleting branches within your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository){:target=_blank .external-link} for guidance.\n\t\t\t\n\n=== \"Single-branch\"\n\n    [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository){:target=_blank .external-link}. \n\n      * Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.  \n      * Create the new repository with a README. This creates the `main` branch, which you'll connect to. \t\t\n\t\t\n\n## Connect your n8n instances to your repository\n\nCreate two n8n instances, one for development, one for production. \n\n### Configure Git in n8n\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/configure-git-in-n8n.md\"\n\n### Set up a deploy key\n\nSet up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access. Refer to [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys){:target=_blank .external-link} for guidance.\n\n### Connect n8n and configure your instance\n\n=== \"Multi-branch\"\n\n    1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.\n    1. Under **Instance settings**, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance. Connect the production branch to the production instance, and the development branch to the development instance.\n    1. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.\n    1. Select **Save settings**.\n\n=== \"Single-branch\"\n\n    1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. \n\t  1. Under **Instance settings**, select the main branch.\n    1. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.\n    1. Select **Save settings**.\n\n## Push work from development\n\nIn your development instance, create a few workflows, tags, variables, and credentials.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/push.md\"\n\n## Pull work to production\n\nYour work is now in GitHub. If you're using a multi-branch setup, it's on the development branch. If you chose the single-branch setup, it's on main.\n\n=== \"Multi-branch\"\n\n    1. In GitHub, create a pull request to merge development into production.\n    1. Merge the pull request.\n    1. In your production instance, select **Pull** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Pull icon](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png){.off-glb}</span> in the main menu.\n\n=== \"Single-branch\"\n\n    In your production instance, select **Pull** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Pull icon](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png){.off-glb}</span> in the main menu.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/push-pull-menu-state.md\"\n\n### Optional: Use a GitHub Action to automate pulls\n\nIf you want to avoid logging in to your production instance to pull, you can use a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions){:target=_blank .external-link} and the [n8n API](/api/) to automatically pull every time you push new work to your production or main branch.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/github-action.md\"\n\n\n## Next steps\n\nLearn more about:\n\n* [Environments in n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/environments/) and [Git and n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/git/)\n* [Source control patterns](/source-control-environments/understand/patterns/)\n* Reusable [Variables](/code/variables/) and [Managing variables using the API](/source-control-environments/using/manage-variables/) when using source control.",

Make a note of the n8n **Redirect URL** and **Entity ID**.\n\t1. **Optional**: if your IdP allows you to set up SAML from imported metadata, navigate to the **Entity ID** URL and save the XML. \n\t2. **Optional**: if you are running n8n behind a load balancer make sure you have `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL` configured. \n1. Set up SAML with your IdP (identity provider). You need the redirect URL and entity ID. You may also need an email address and name for the IdP user.\n1. After completing setup in your IdP, load the metadata XML into n8n. You can use a metadata URL or raw XML:\n\t1. **Metadata URL**: Copy the metadata URL from your IdP into the **Identity Provider Settings** field in n8n.\n\t1. **Raw XML**: Download the metadata XML from your IdP, toggle **Identiy Provider Settings** to **XML**, then copy the raw XML into **Identity Provider Settings**.\n1. Select **Save settings**.\n1. Select **Test settings** to check your SAML setup is working.\n1. Set SAML 2.0 to **Activated**.\n\n## Generic IdP setup\n\nThe steps to configure the IdP vary depending on your chosen IdP.

This document helps you understand:\n\n* The purpose of environments.\n* How environments work in n8n.\n\n## Environments: What and why\n\nIn software development, the environment is all the infrastructure and tooling around the code, including the tools that run the software, and the specific configuration of those tools. For a more detailed introduction to environments in software development, refer to [Codecademy | Environments](https://www.codecademy.com/article/environments){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\nLow-code development in n8n is similar. n8n is where you build and run your workflows. Your instance may have particular configurations: on Cloud, n8n determines the configuration. On self-hosted instances, there are extensive [configuration options](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/). You may also have made changes to the settings of your instance. This combination of n8n and your instance's specific configuration and settings is the environment your workflows run in.\n\nThere are advantages to having more than one environment. A common pattern is to have different environments for development and production:\n\n* Development: do work and make changes.\n* Production: the live environment.\n\nA setup like this helps you make changes to workflows without breaking workflows that are in use.\n\n## Environments in n8n\n\nIn n8n, an environment comprises two parts, an n8n instance and a Git branch:\n\n* The n8n instance is where you build and run workflows.\n* The Git branch stores copies of the workflows, as well as tags, and variable and credential stubs.\n\nn8n doesn't sync credentials and variable values with Git. You must set up the credentials and variable values manually when setting up a new instance. For more information, refer to [Push and pull | What gets committed](/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/#what-gets-committed) and [Manage variables](/source-control-environments/using/manage-variables/).\n\nHow you copy work between environments depends on your branch and n8n instance configuration:\n\n* Multiple instances, one branch: you can push from one instance to the Git branch, then pull the work to another instance.\n* Multiple instances, multiple branches: you need to create a pull request and merge in your Git provider. For example, if you have development, test, and production branches, each linked to their own instance, you need to merge the development branch into test to make the work from the development instance available on the test instance. Refer to [Copy work between environments](/source-control-environments/using/copy-work/) for more information, including steps to partially automate the process.\n\nFor detailed guidance on pushing and pulling work, refer to [Push and pull](/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/).\n\nRefer to [Set up source control](/source-control-environments/setup/) to learn more about linking your n8n instance to Git, or follow the [Tutorial: Create environments with source control](/source-control-environments/create-environments/) to set up your environments using one of n8n's recommended configurations.",

You can create different setups depending on your needs. \n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/one-direction.md\"\n\n## Multiple instances, multiple branches\n\nThis pattern involves having multiple n8n instances, each one linked to its own branch. \n\nYou can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them to their own branches. Push work from your development instance to its branch, do a pull request to move work to the production branch, then pull to the production instance.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/multi-instance-multi-branch-pros-cons.md\"\n\n![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)\n\n## Multiple instances, one branch\n\nUse this pattern if you want the same workflows, tags, and variables everywhere, but want to use them in different n8n instances. \n\nYou can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them both to the same branch. Push work from development, and pull it into production.\n\nThis pattern is also useful when testing a new version of n8n: you can create a new n8n instance with the new version, connect it to the Git branch and test it, while your production instance remains on the older version until you're confident it's safe to upgrade.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/multi-instance-one-branch-pros-cons.md\"\n\n![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)\n\n## One instance, multiple branches\n\nThe instance owner can change which Git branch connects to the instance. The full setup in this case is likely to be a [Multiple instances, multiple branches](#multiple-instances-multiple-branches) pattern, but with one instance switching between branches.\n\nThis is useful to review work. For example, different users could work on their own instance and push to their own branch. The reviewer could work in a review instance, and switch between branches to load work from different users.\n\n/// note | No cleanup\nn8n doesn't clean up the existing contents of an instance when changing branches. Switching branches in this pattern results in all the workflows from each branch being in your instance.\n///\n![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-one-multi.png)\n\n## One instance, one branch\n\nThis is the simplest pattern.\n\n![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-one-one.png)",

Push work from one instance to the Git branch.\n1. Log in to the other instance to pull the work from Git. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).\n\n## Multiple branches\n\nIf you have more than one Git branch, you need to merge the branches in your Git provider to copy work between environments. You can't copy work directly between environments in n8n. \n\nA common pattern is:\n\n1. Do work in your developments instance.\n1. Push the work to the development branch in Git.\n1. Merge your development branch into your production branch.\tRefer to the documentation for your Git provider for guidance on doing this:  \n\t* [GitHub: Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request){:target=_blank .external-link}\n\t* [GitLab: Creating merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html){:target=_blank .external-link}\n\t* [Git: Basic branching and merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging){:target=_blank .external-link}\n1. In your production n8n instance, pull the changes. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).\n\n## Automatically send changes to n8n\n\nYou can automate parts of the process of copying work, using the `/source-control/pull` API endpoint. Call the API after merging the changes:\n\n```curl\ncurl --request POST \\\n\t--location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \\\n\t--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n\t--header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \\\n\t--data '{\"force\": true}'\n```\n\nThis means you can use a GitHub Action or GitLab CI/CD to automatically pull changes to the production instance on merge.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/github-action.md\"",

You can choose to set up variables manually, or [using the API](#manage-variables-using-the-api).\n\n## Manage variables using the API\n\nn8n syncs variable names, but doesn't push variable values to your Git provider. You can either:\n\n* Manually set variable values in n8n.\n* Set variable values using the n8n API, using the `/pull` endpoint. \n\nManaging variables using the API has several advantages:\n\n* You can automatically update variable values using a CI (continuous integration) tool. \n* You may also be able to protect the values. \n\nFor example, you can store values in [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets){:target=_blank .external-link}, then populate the variables in n8n using an API call from a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n\nTo manage variables using an API call, make a `POST` request to `/source-control/pull`:\n\n```curl\n\tcurl --location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \\\n\t--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n\t--header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \\\n\t--data '{\n\t\"force\": true,\n\t\"variables\": { \n\t\t\t\"key1\": \"value1\",\n\t\t\t\"key2\": \"value2\"\n\t}\n\t}\n\t'\n```\n\nIf the key already exists in n8n, the API call updates the value. If there is no variable with the key, it creates a new variable.\n\nAfter setting values using the API, you can safely edit variables in n8n, and push and pull changes.",

Refer to [Git and n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/git/) for an introduction to how n8n works with Git.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/one-direction.md\"\n\n## Fetch other people's work\n\n/// note | Restricted to instance owners\nOrdinary users can't fetch work from Git.\n///\nTo pull work from Git, select **Pull** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Pull icon](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png){.off-glb}</span> in the main menu.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/push-pull-menu-state.md\"\n\nn8n may display a warning about overriding local changes. Select **Pull and override** to override your local work with the content in Git.\n\n### Workflow and credential owner may change on pull\n\nWhen you pull from Git to an n8n instance, n8n tries to assign workflows and credentials to a matching user or project.\n\nIf the original owner is a user:\n\nIf the same owner is available on both instances (matching email), the owner remains the same. If the original owner isn't on the new instance, n8n sets the user performing the pull as the workflow owner.\n\nIf the original owner is a [project](/user-management/rbac/):\n\nn8n tries to match the original project name to a project name on the new instance. If no matching project exists, n8n creates a new project with the name, assigns the current user as project owner, and imports the workflows and credentials to the project.\n\n### Pulling may cause brief service interruption\n\nIf you pull changes to an active workflow, n8n sets the workflow to inactive while pulling, then reactivates it. This may result in a few seconds of downtime for the workflow.\n\n## Send your work to Git\n\n/// note | Restricted to instance owners\nOrdinary users can't send work to Git.\n///\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/push.md\"\n\n## What gets committed\n\nn8n commits the following to Git:\n\n* Workflows, including their tags and the email address of the workflow owner. You can choose which workflows to push.\n* Credential stubs (ID, name, type)\n* Variable stubs (ID and name)\n* Projects\n\nYou can programmatically [Manage variables](/source-control-environments/using/manage-variables/) using the n8n API.\n\n/// note | Coming soon: credential support with secret managers\nn8n is working on support for external secret managers to handle credentials. Once this feature is complete, n8n will support linking the secret manager to multiple instances.\n///\n## Merge behaviors and conflicts\n\nn8n's implementation of source control is opinionated. It resolves merge conflicts for credentials and variables automatically. n8n can't detect conflicts on workflows.\n\n### Workflows\n\nYou have to explicitly tell n8n what to do about workflows when pushing or pulling. The Git repository acts as the source of truth.\n\nWhen pulling, you might get warned that your local copy of a workflow differs from Git, and if you accept, your local copy would be overridden. Be careful not to lose relevant changes when pulling.\n\nWhen you push, your local workflow will override what's in Git, so make sure that you have the most up to date version or you risk overriding recent changes.\n\nTo prevent the issue described above, you should immediately push your changes to a workflow once you finish working on it. Then it's safe to pull.\n\nTo avoid losing data:\n\n* Design your source control setup so that workflows flow in one direction. For example, make edits on a development instance, push to Git, then pull to production. Don't make edits on the production instance and push them.\n* Don't push all workflows. Select the ones you need.\n* Be cautious about manually editing files in the Git repository.\n\n### Credentials, variables and workflow tags\n\nCredentials and variables can't have merge issues, as n8n chooses the version to keep.\n\nOn pull:\n\n* If the tag, variable or credential doesn't exist, n8n creates it.\n* If the tag, variable or credential already exists, n8n doesn't update it, unless:\n\t* You set the value of a variable using the API or externally. The new value overwrites any existing value.\n\t* The credential name has changed. n8n uses the version in Git.\n\t* The name of a tag has changed. n8n updates the tag name. Be careful when renaming tags as tag names are unique and this could cause database issues when it comes to uniqueness during the pull process.\n\nOn push:\n\n* n8n overwrites the entire variables and tags files.\n* If a credential already exists, n8n overwrites it with the changes, but doesn't apply these changes to existing credentials on pull.\n\n/// note | Manage credentials with an external secrets vault\nIf you need different credentials on different n8n environments, use [External secrets](/external-secrets/).\n///",
    "longer-introduction.md": "---\n#https://www.notion.so/n8n/Frontmatter-432c2b8dff1f43d4b1c8d20075510fe4\ndescription: Quickstart covering key concepts in n8n.\ncontentType: tutorial\n---\n\n# A slightly longer introduction\n\nThis guide shows you how to automate a task using a workflow in n8n, explaining key concepts along the way. You will:\n\n* Create a workflow from scratch. You'll build a workflow that runs every week to get data from NASA, filters the data, and generates two reports.\n* Understand key concepts and skills, including:\n    * Starting workflows with trigger nodes\n    * Configuring credentials\n    * Manipulating data\n    * Representing logic in an n8n workflow\n    * Using expressions\n\n\n## Step one: Sign up for n8n\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/try-it-out/install-run-n8n.md\"\n\n## Step two: New workflow\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/try-it-out/new-workflow.md\"\n\n\n## Step three: Add a trigger node\n\nn8n provides two ways to start a workflow:\n\n* Manually, by selecting **Test Workflow**, or from the CLI if you installed n8n with npm or Docker.\n* Automatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings.\n\nFor this tutorial, use the [Schedule trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/). This allows you to run the workflow on a schedule:\n\n1. Select **Add first step**.\n2. Search for **Schedule**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n3. Select **Schedule Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.\n4. For **Trigger Interval**, select **Weeks**.\n5. For **Weeks Between Triggers**, enter `1`.\n6. Enter a time and day. For this example, select **Monday** in **Trigger on Weekdays**, select **9am** in **Trigger at Hour**, and enter `0` in **Trigger at Minute**.\n7. Close the node details view to return to the canvas.\n\n\n## Step four: Add the NASA node and set up credentials\n\nThe [NASA node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.nasa/) allows you to interact with NASA's [public APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/){:target=_blank .external-link}. The API gives you data to work with in this tutorial.\n\n1. Select the **Add node** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector on the Schedule Trigger node.\n2. Search for **NASA**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n3. Select **NASA** to view a list of operations.\n4. Search for and select **Get a DONKI solar flare**. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\n5. To access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials:\n    1. Select the  **Credential for NASA API** dropdown.\n    2. Select **- Create New -**. n8n opens the credentials view.\n    3. Go to [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/){:target=_blank .external-link} and fill out the form in **Generate API Key**. NASA generates the key and displays it.\n    4. Copy the key, and paste it into **API Key** in n8n.\n    5. Select **Save**.\n    6. Close the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in **Credential for NASA API**.\n6. By default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use **Additional Fields**:\n    1. Select **Add field**.\n    2. Select **Start date**.\n    3. To get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to **Start date**, select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the full expressions editor.\n    4. In the **Expression** field, enter the following expression:\n    ```js\n    {{$today.minus({days: 7}).toFormat('yyyy-MM-dd')}}\n    ```\n    This generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date.\n\n    /// note | Date and time in n8n\n    n8n uses Luxon to work with date and time, and also provides two variables for convenience: `$now` and `$today`. For more information, refer to [Expressions > Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/). \n    ///\n\n7. Close the **Edit Expression** modal to return to the NASA node.\n8. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Test step** to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the **OUTPUT** section.\n9. Close the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas.\n\n## Step five: Add logic with the If node\n\nn8n supports complex logic in workflows. In this tutorial, use the [If node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if) to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications. You'll create logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another. \n\nAdd the If node:\n\n1. Select the **Add node** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector on the NASA node.\n1. Search for **If**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n1. Select **If** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.\n1. You need to check the value of the `classType` property in the NASA data. To do this:\n\t1. Drag **classType** into **Value 1**.\n\n\t\t/// note | Make sure you ran the NASA node in the previous section\n\t\tIf you didn't follow the step in the previous section to run the NASA node, you won't see any data to work with in this step.\n\t\t///\n\n    2. Change the comparison operation to **Contains**.\n    3. In **Value 2**, enter **X**. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares.\n1. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Test step** to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the **OUTPUT** panel.\n\n/// note | Weeks without large solar flares\nIn this tutorial, you are working with live date. If you find there aren't any X class solar flares when you run the workflow, try replacing **X** in **Value 2** with either **A**, **B**, **C**, or **M**. \n///\n\n## Step six: Output data from your workflow\n\nThe last step of the workflow is to send the two reports about solar flares. For this example, you'll send data to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/){:target=_blank .external-link}. Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page. \n\n1. On the If node, select the **Add node** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node.png){.off-glb}</span> connector labeled **true**.\n1. Search for **PostBin**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n1. Select **PostBin**.\n1. Select **Send a request**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\n1. Go to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/){:target=_blank .external-link} and select **Create Bin**. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow.\n1. Copy the bin ID. It looks similar to `1651063625300-2016451240051`.\n1. In n8n, paste your Postbin ID into **Bin ID**.\n1. Now, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to **Bin Content**, select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the full expressions editor.\n1. Select **Current Node** > **Input Data** > **JSON** > **classType**. n8n adds the expression to the **Expression** editor, and displays a sample output.\n1. The expression is: `{{$json[\"classType\"]}}`. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is:\n    ```js\n    There was a solar flare of class {{$json[\"classType\"]}}\n    ```\n1. Close the expressions editor to return to the node.\n1. Close the Postbin node to return to the canvas.\n1. Add another Postbin node, to handle the **false** output path from the If node:\n    1. Hover over the Postbin node, then select **Node context menu** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Node context menu icon](/_images/common-icons/node-context-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> > **Duplicate node** to duplicate the first Postbin node.\n    2. Drag the **false** connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node.\n\n## Step seven: Test the workflow\n\n1. You can now test the entire workflow. Select **Test Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress.\n2. Go back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output.\n3. If you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to activate it by selecting the **Active** toggle.\n\n/// note | Time limit\nPostbin's bins exist for 30 minutes after creation. You may need to create a new bin and update the ID in the Postbin nodes, if you exceed this time limit.\n///\n\n## Next steps\n\n* Take n8n's [text courses](/courses/) or [video courses](/video-courses/).\n* Explore more examples in [workflow templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/){:target=_blank .external-link}.",

Its aim is to allow you to try out the UI, and introduce you to two key features: workflow templates and expressions. It doesn't include detailed explanations or explore concepts.\n\nYou will:\n\n* Load a workflow from the workflow templates library\n* Add a node and configure it using expressions.\n* Run your first workflow\n\n## Step one: Sign up for n8n\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/try-it-out/install-run-n8n.md\"\n\n## Step two: Open a workflow template\n\nn8n provides a quickstart template using training nodes. This allows you to work with fake data, and avoids setting up credentials.\n\n1. Go to [Templates | Very quick quickstart](https://n8n.io/workflows/1700-very-quick-quickstart/){:target=_blank .external-link}.\n1. Select **Use workflow** to view the options for using the template.\n1. Select **Import template to <name> cloud workspace** to load the template into your Cloud instance.\n\nThis workflow:\n\n1. Gets example data from the Customer Datastore node.\n2. Uses the Edit Fields node to extract just the data you want, and assign that data to variables. In this example, you use the customer name, ID, and description.\n\nThe individual pieces in an n8n workflow are called nodes. Double click a node to explore its settings and how it processes data.\n\n## Step three: Run the workflow\n\nSelect **Test Workflow**. This runs the workflow, loading the data from the Customer Datastore node, then transforming it with Edit Fields. You need this data available in the workflow so that you can work with it in the next step.\n\n## Step four: Add a node\n\nAdd a third node to message each customer and tell them their description. Use the Customer Messenger node to send a message to fake recipients.\n\n1. Select the **Add node** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector on the Edit Fields node.\n2. Search for **Customer Messenger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n3. Select **Customer Messenger (n8n training)** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node automatically.\n4. Use [expressions](/code/expressions/) to map in the **Customer ID** and create the **Message**:\n\t1. Drag **customer_id** from the **INPUT** panel into the **Customer ID** field in the node settings.\n    2. Hover over **Message**. Select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the full expressions editor.\n    3. Copy this expression into the editor:\n        ```\n        Hi {{$json.customer_name}},  Your description is {{$json.customer_description}}\n        ```\n5. Close the expressions editor, then close the **Customer Messenger** node by clicking outside the node or selecting **Back to canvas**.\n6. Select **Test Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow.\n\nThe complete workflow should look like this:\n\n![Screenshot of completed quickstart workflow](/_images/try-it-out/quickstart/very-quick-quickstart-workflow.png)\n\n\n## Next steps\n\n* Read n8n's [longer try it out tutorial](/try-it-out/longer-introduction/) for a more complex workflow, and an introduction to more features and n8n concepts.\n* Take the [text courses](/courses/) or [video courses](/video-courses/).",

This overwrites the whole custom data object for this execution:\n\n=== \"JavaScript\"\n\t```js\n\t$execution.customData.setAll({\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"})\n\t```\n=== \"Python\"\n\t```python\n\t_execution.customData.setAll({\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"})\n\t```\n\nThere are limitations:\n\n* They must be strings\n* `key` has a maximum length of 50 characters\n* `value` has a maximum length of 255 characters\n* n8n supports a maximum of 10 items of custom data\n\n### Access the custom data object during execution\n\nYou can retrieve the custom data object, or a specific value in it, during an execution:\n\n<!-- vale off -->\n=== \"JavaScript\"\n\t```js\n\t// Access the current state of the object during the execution\n\tconst customData = $execution.customData.getAll();\n\n\t// Access a specific value set during this execution\n\tconst customData = $execution.customData.get(\"key\");\n\t```\n=== \"Python\"\n\t```python\n\t# Access the current state of the object during the execution\n\tcustomData = _execution.customData.getAll();\n\n\t# Access a specific value set during this execution\n\tcustomData = _execution.customData.get(\"key\");\n\t```\n<!-- vale on -->",

This is useful for debugging data from failed production executions: you can see a failed execution, make changes to your workflow to fix it, then re-run it with the previous execution data.\n\n## Load data\n\nTo load data from a previous execution:\n\n1. In your workflow, select the **Executions** tab to view the **Executions** list.\n1. Select the execution you want to debug. n8n displays options depending on whether the workflow was successful or failed:\n\t* For failed executions: select **Debug in editor**.\n\t* For successful executions: select **Copy to editor**.\n1. n8n copies the execution data into your current workflow, and [pins the data](/data/data-pinning/) in the first node in the workflow.\n\n/// note | Check which executions you save\nThe executions available on the **Executions** list depends on your [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings/).\n///",

This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.\n///\n\n/// note | Execution history and workflow history\nDon't confuse the execution list with [Workflow history](/workflows/history/).\n\nExecutions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](/workflows/executions/debug/) in your current workflow.\n\nWorkflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.\n///\n\n\n## View executions for a single workflow\n\nIn the workflow, select the **Executions** tab in the top menu. You can preview all executions of that workflow.\n\n## Filter executions\n\nYou can filter the executions list.\n\n1. In your workflow, select **Executions**.\t\n2. Select **Filters**.\n3. Enter your filters. You can filter by:\n\t* **Status**: choose from **Failed**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**.\n\t* **Execution start**: see executions that started in the given time.\n\t* **Saved custom data**: this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to [Custom executions data](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/) for information on adding custom data.\n\n\t\t--8<-- \"_snippets/workflows/executions/custom-execution-data-availability.md\"\n\n\n## Retry failed workflows\n\nIf your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:\n\n1. Open the **Executions** list.\n2. For the workflow execution you want to retry, select **Refresh** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Refresh icon](/_images/common-icons/refresh.png){.off-glb}</span>.\n--8<-- \"_snippets/workflows/executions/retry-options.md\"",
