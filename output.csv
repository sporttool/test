CODE_OF_CONDUCT,"# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at jan@n8n.io. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

CONTRIBUTING,"# Contributing

If you want to contribute to this repository - thank you! Before you start, have a look at the existing documentation to get an idea of the structure and writing conventions n8n uses. In writing your documentation, please follow the guidelines described below, to ensure quality and consistency with n8n styles.

## Before you start

### Style

n8n uses the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

Refer to [Styles](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/wiki/Styles/) for a quickstart, and guidance on style linting.

### n8n's license

Be aware that n8n is fair code licensed. For more information, refer to the [License](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) documentation.

## Writing docs

You can either:

* Check out the docs repository and work on your local machine.
* Make your changes directly in GitHub.

These instructions are for external users. Members of the n8n organization don't need to fork the repository.

### Working locally

This method allows you to work in your own text editor, and preview your work while editing.

You need Git installed, and a GitHub account.

[Fork the documentation repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

Then clone your fork:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/n8n-docs.git
cd n8n-docs
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Make your changes. Push your branch:

```
git add *
git commit -m ""<short summary of changes>""
git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
```

In GitHub, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to merge the work from your fork to `main` in the docs repository.

### Writing in GitHub

This method is fine for small changes, but not recommended for larger pieces of work.

You need a GitHub account.

Follow GitHub's documentation on [editing files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files).

### Previewing your work

You can build the docs locally to preview them, or submit a pull request. All pull requests automatically trigger a preview build.

For instructions on previewing the docs locally, refer to the [README](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/main/README.md).

### General checklist

Before submitting a PR, make sure your contribution ticks all these boxes:

- [ ] All necessary files and images are included.
- [ ] All links are working and direct to the right location.
- [ ] All documentation files end with an empty newline.
- [ ] The commit message describes the changes you made.
- [ ] The PR explains the changes you made and why they're necessary.
- [ ] You have read and accepted the [code of conduct](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [contributor license agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md).


## Documenting nodes

n8n provides [templates](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/tree/main/document-templates) for node docs.

* **Nodes and trigger nodes:** Create a directory with the name of the node at `docs/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/` or `docs/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/` containing:

  - A text file named `n8n-nodes-base.<node-name>.md` describing the functionality of the relevant node.

* **Credentials:** Create a document with the name of the node at `docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/` containing:
  - A text file with the node name describing how to get credentials for the relevant node.

A standard node doc includes the following parts:

* Node description
  - Describe the purpose and function of the node.
* Operations
  - Enter the resources and operations as they're named in the nodes.

In the credentials doc:

* If there is more than one authentication method, list OAuth first.
* If possible, avoid documenting external products. Instead, provide links to the relevant product documentation. For example, for guidance on getting credentials (such as how to get an API token for a service), provide a link to the product's API authentication docs."

      ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# n8n Docs

This repository hosts the documentation for [n8n](https://n8n.io/), an extendable workflow automation tool which enables you to connect anything to everything. The documentation is live at [docs.n8n.io](https://docs.n8n.io/).


## Previewing and building the documentation locally

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or above
* Pip
* n8n recommends using a virtual environment when working with Python, such as [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
* Follow the [recommended configuration and auto-complete](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#minimal-configuration) guidance for the theme. This will help when working with the `mkdocs.yml` file.
* The repo includes a `.editorconfig` file. Make sure your local editor settings **do not override** these settings. In particular:
	- Don't allow your editor to replace tabs with spaces. This can affect our code samples (which must retain tabs for people building nodes).
	- One tab must be equivalent to four spaces.

### Steps

#### For members of the n8n GitHub organization:

1. Set up an SSH token and add it to your GitHub account. Refer to [GitHub | About SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh) for guidance.
2. Then run these commands:

	```bash
	git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:n8n-io/n8n-docs.git
	cd n8n-docs
 	# Set up virtual environment if using one (steps depend on your system)
 	# Install dependencies
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	pip install _submodules/insiders
	```

#### For external contributors:

Rely on the preview builds on pull requests, or use the free version of Material for MkDocs (most things are the same, some formatting may be missing)

Fork the repository, then:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/n8n-docs.git
cd n8n-docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install mkdocs-material
```

#### To serve a local preview:

```
mkdocs serve
```

create-n8n-nodes-module,"# Creating n8n-nodes-module

[TODO: this is the most up to date method, use it]

In this guide, you'll learn to create a custom n8n-nodes-module that can be installed separately alongside your n8n instance. The n8n-nodes-module is an npm package that contains the node. Your custom node will get loaded automatically when n8n starts.

Consider creating n8n-nodes-module if any of the following conditions satisfy your needs:
- The nodes are only for yourself, your organization, or a small group of people.
- The nodes require external dependencies that are not already available in n8n.

**NOTE:** n8n-nodes-module can only be installed in self-hosted n8n instances. This functionality is currently not available on n8n Cloud or the desktop app. There are plans to introduce this functionality in the future.

## Prerequisites

You may already be familiar with creating nodes in n8n. If you are unfamiliar with how to create n8n nodes, you can learn about it following the instructions mentioned in the [Creating Your First Node](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/creating-nodes/create-node.html) tutorial.

Install the following tools:

- **Git:** You can find instructions on how to install Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Node.js and npm:** You can find instructions how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). The current minimum version is `14.15`. In case you already have Node.js and npm installed, you can check the current version with the following command:
	```bash
	node -v
	npm -v
	```

**NOTE:** Use node version `14.x` and npm version `6.x`. If using npm version `7+`, you must enable legacy peer dependencies by setting: `npm config set legacy-peer-deps true`.

[TODO: remove lerna per alex]

- **Lerna:** You can install lerna globally with the following command:
	```bash
	npm i
	```

- Install n8n: Create a new folder and install n8n using the command:

```bash
npm install n8n
```

## Create custom n8n-nodes-module

You can create multiple n8n-nodes-modules. Each individual n8n-nodes-module should get created in a separate folder since they are different npm packages. A single n8n-nodes-module can contain multiple nodes. If you're creating multiple nodes in the same module, as a best practice create each node in a separate folder.

In this tutorial, you will create an n8n-nodes-module for the OpenWeatherMap API. You will name it ***n8n-nodes-weather***.

To quickly get started, clone the example starter using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter.git n8n-nodes-weather.
```

After the repo gets cloned, open the package.json file, and update the value of the name by replacing `n8n-nodes-starter` with `n8n-nodes-weather`.

**NOTE:** The name of the module has to start with `n8n-nodes-`.

Open the cloned repository in your code editor, and create a new folder called `Weather`, inside the ***nodes*** folder. Create `Weather.node.ts` file inside the Weather folder and paste the following code:

```ts
import {
	IDataObject,
	IExecuteFunctions,

```

The OpenWeatherMap API requires credentials to return results successfully. Create `WeatherApi.credentials.ts` file in the ***Credentials*** folder and paste the following code:

```ts
import {
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';


export class WeatherApi implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'weatherApi';
	displayName = 'Weather API';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'Access Token',
			name: 'accessToken',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];
}
```

Add the newly created node and the credential to the package.json file. Add `""dist/nodes/Weather/Weather.node.js""` to the ***nodes*** array in the ***n8n*** object (`n8n.nodes`). Similarly, add `""dist/credentials/WeatherApi.credentials.js""` to the ***credentials*** array in the ***n8n*** object (`n8n.credentials`).

## Develop and test the module

Once you've created the n8n-nodes-module, you need to build the code and publish the package locally to test it. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the code
npm run build

# ""Publish"" the package locally
npm link
```

**NOTE:** If you get permission errors, run the command as a root user with `sudo`, for example `sudo npm link`.

In the terminal, open the folder where you installed n8n. Run the following command to install the locally published module.

```bash
# ""Install"" the above locally published module
npm link n8n-nodes-weather
```

Start n8n with the below command

```bash
./node_modules/n8n/bin/n8n start
```

You will now be able to test and use your newly created n8n-nodes-module.

## Publish the n8n-nodes-module

As mentioned, the n8n-nodes-module is an npm package. To make it available to others, you can publish it to the npm registry. Refer to the [Publishing unscoped public packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages#publishing-unscoped-public-packages) guide to learn about publishing packages.

Following the steps mentioned above, you can create multiple nodes within a single n8n-nodes-module. You can also create nodes that require dependencies that are not present in n8n. When creating an n8n-nodes-module make sure that you follow the following guidelines:

- The name of the module should start with `n8n-nodes-`.
- The `package.json` file has to contain a key `n8n` with the paths to nodes and credentials.
- The module has to be installed alongside n8n.

## Use the n8n-nodes-module in production

Once you test and publish your n8n-nodes-module you would want to use it in your production environment.

If you're running n8n via Docker, you will have to create a Docker image with the node module installed in n8n. Follow the steps below to create your Docker image:

1. Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile).
2. Add the following command in your Dockerfile before the font installation command.

	```Dockerfile
	RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install n8n-nodes-weather
	```

	Your Dockerfile should look like this:

	```Dockerfile
	FROM node:16-alpine

	ARG N8N_VERSION

	RUN if [ -z ""$N8N_VERSION"" ] ; then echo ""The N8N_VERSION argument is missing!"" ; exit 1; fi

	# Update everything and install needed dependencies
	RUN apk add --update graphicsmagick tzdata git tini su-exec

	# Set a custom user to not have n8n run as root
	USER root

	# Install n8n and the packages it needs to build it correctly.
	RUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies python3 build-base ca-certificates && \
		npm config set python ""$(which python3)"" && \
		npm_config_user=root npm install -g full-icu n8n@${N8N_VERSION} && \
		apk del build-dependencies \
		&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root;

	# Install your n8n-nodes-module. Replace <n8n-nodes-module> with the name of your module
	RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install <n8n-nodes-module>

	# Install fonts
	RUN apk --no-cache add --virtual fonts msttcorefonts-installer fontconfig && \
		update-ms-fonts && \
		fc-cache -f && \
		apk del fonts && \
		find  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/ -type l -exec unlink {} \; \
		&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root

	ENV NODE_ICU_DATA /usr/local/lib/node_modules/full-icu

	WORKDIR /data

	COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh
	ENTRYPOINT [""tini"", ""--"", ""/docker-entrypoint.sh""]

	EXPOSE 5678/tcp
	```

3. Download the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/docker-entrypoint.sh) file, and place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile.

4. Build your Docker image:

	```Dockerfile
	# Replace <n8n-version-number> with the n8n release version number.
	# For example, N8N_VERSION=0.177.0
	docker build --build-arg N8N_VERSION=<n8n-version-number> --tag=customizedn8n .
	```

You can now use your n8n-nodes-module in Docker.

If you're running either by installing it globally or using PM2, make sure that you install your n8n-nodes-module inside n8n. n8n will find the module and load it automatically."

# Creating Your First Trigger Node

This tutorial walks through building a trigger node.

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/prerequisites.md""

You need some understanding of:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- REST APIs
- Webhooks
- Expressions in n8n
- git



## Build your node

The first thing that we have to do is pick the service we want to create the node for. We will use [Autopilot](https://www.autopilothq.com/) as an example.


Since n8n's repository already has a Autopilot Trigger node, we will name this node **Autofriend Trigger** to avoid conflicts.

### Step 1: Set up the project

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/tutorial-set-up-project.md""


## Creating the node

1. Go to `packages/nodes-base/nodes`.
2. Create a folder called `Autofriend` (the folder names are PascalCase).
3. Within the Autofriend folder, create a file called `AutofriendTrigger.node.ts` (YourNodeNameTrigger.node.ts).
4. Download and add the Autofriend [icon](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autopilot/autopilot.svg) to the folder. Name it `autopilot.svg`.
	- The icon property has to be either a 60x60 pixels PNG or an SVG and must exist in the node's folder.
	- An SVG is preferable. In case you have to use a PNG, make sure that it's compressed. A good tool for that's [tinypng](https://tinypng.com).
	- A good place to find company icons is [gilbarbara/logos](https://github.com/gilbarbara/logos/tree/master/logos).
5. Paste the following code in the `AutofriendTrigger.node.ts` file.

```typescript
import {
   IDataObject,
   IHookFunctions,
   INodeType,
   INodeTypeDescription,
   IWebhookFunctions,
   IWebhookResponseData,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

/*
import {
	autofriendApiRequest,
} from './GenericFunctions';

import {
	snakeCase,
} from 'change-case';
*/


export class AutofriendTrigger implements INodeType {
   description: INodeTypeDescription = {
	   displayName: 'Autofriend Trigger',
	   name: 'autofriendTrigger',
	   icon: 'file:autofriend.svg',
	   group: ['trigger'],
	   version: 1,
	   subtitle: '={{$parameter[""event""]}}',
	   description: 'Handle Autofriend events using webhooks',
	   defaults: {
		   name: 'Autofriend Trigger',
		   color: '#6ad7b9',
	   },
	   inputs: [],
	   outputs: ['main'],
	   credentials: [],
	   webhooks: [
		   {
			   name: 'default',
			   httpMethod: 'POST',
			   responseMode: 'onReceived',
			   path: 'webhook',
		   },
	   ],
	   properties: [],
   };
   async webhook(this: IWebhookFunctions): Promise<IWebhookResponseData> {
	   return {
		   workflowData: [],
	   };
   }
}
```

Your directory structure should now look like the following.

![Autofriend's directory structure](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/autopilot-directory-structure.png)


## Adding the node to Editor UI

n8n uses the properties set in the property `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `name`, `color`, `icon`, `description`, and `subtitle`.

Check the following figure to see how the properties affect the looks of the node.

![Autofriend's appearance in Editor UI](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/autopilot-appearance.png)

**Note:** The property description conforms to [INodeTypeDescription](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/f2666e92ffed2c3983d08e73b1e45a2bd516b90d/packages/workflow/src/Interfaces.ts#L425).

Let's see how the node looks in the UI by following these steps:

1. Go to `/packages/nodes-base/package.json`.
2. Paste `""dist/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.js"",` in the nodes array to register the node (in an alphabetical order).
3. Go to the project's main folder (n8n) in the terminal and run the following commands (it can take a few minutes).
	- The first command installs all dependencies of all the modules and links them together.
	- The second command builds all the code.
	- The third command starts n8n in development mode.

```bash
lerna bootstrap --hoist
npm run build
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and you should be able to see the Editor UI.
5. Open the ***Create Node*** menu, select the ***Trigger*** tab, type `Autofriend`, and click on it to add the node to the Editor UI.

**Notes**

- On startup, n8n will load all the nodes and credentials (more about credentials later) that are registered in `/packages/nodes-base/package.json`.
- The property `description.name` uses camelCase.
- The property `description.color` is the company's branding color in hexadecimal. In case the website doesn'tinclude this information, there are other websites that help you get a company's branding colors. For example, [brandpalettes.com](https://brandpalettes.com/).


## Creating the UI for the node

Double-clicking on the Autofriend Trigger node will open the Node Editor View. It will be empty since we haven't added any UI components yet. Luckily, n8n provides predefined JSON-based UI components that we can use to ask the user for different types of data.

Autopilots's [docs](https://autopilot.docs.apiary.io/#reference/rest-hooks/register-rest-hook/register-a-rest-hook) mention that to create a hook, we need to provide the following pieces of information:

- event - Required
- target_url - Required

In the `event` parameter, we provide the name of the event for which we want to be notified. For example, `contact_added`. As the name implies, by providing `contact_added` as the event, we will be notified every time a contact is added to Autofriend.

In the `target_url` parameter, we provide the URL where Autofriend will notify us when the event defined in the event parameter takes place. We don't need to ask the user for this parameter as n8n provides us with a method to obtain it.


### Adding the fields

Let's make the Node Editor View ask for these parameters:
1. Add the following under `description.properties` in `packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.ts.`.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Event',
	name: 'event',
	type: 'options',
	required: true,
	default: '',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Contact Added',
			value: 'contactAdded',
		},
		{
			name: 'Contact Added To List',
			value: 'contactAddedToList',
		},
		{
			name: 'Contact Entered Segment',
			value: 'contactEnteredSegment',
		},
		{
			name: 'Contact Left Segment',
			value: 'contactLeftSegment',
		},
		{
			name: 'Contact Removed From List',
			value: 'contactRemovedFromList',
		},
		{
			name: 'Contact Unsubscribed',
			value: 'contactUnsubscribed',
		},
		{
			name: 'Contact Updated',
			value: 'contactUpdated',
		},
	],
},
```

2. Stop the current n8n process by pressing `ctrl + c` in the terminal in which you are running n8n.
3. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal.
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/), refresh the page, and open the node again.

The node should now look like in the following image.

![Autofriend's required fields](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/autofriend-fields.png)


## Creating the UI for credentials

Most REST APIs use some sort of authentication mechanism. Autofriend's REST API uses API Keys. The API Key informs them about who is making the request to their system and gives you access to all the functionality that the API provides. Given all the things it can do, this has to be treated as a sensitive piece of information and should be kept private.

n8n gives you the ability to ask for sensitive information using credentials. In the credentials, you can use all the generally available UI elements. Additionally, the data that's stored using the credentials would be encrypted before being saved to the database. In order to do that, n8n uses an encryption key.

With that in mind, let's create the UI to ask for the user's Autofriend API Key. The process of creating and registering credentials is similar to that of creating and registering the node:

1. Go to `packages/nodes-base/credentials`.
2. Within the credentials folder, create a file named `AutofriendApi.credentials.ts`.
3. Paste the following code.

```typescript
import {
	ICredentialType,
	NodePropertyTypes,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class AutofriendApi implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'autofriendApi';
	displayName = 'Autofriend API';
	properties = [
		{
			displayName: 'API Key',
			name: 'apiKey',
			type: 'string' as NodePropertyTypes,
			default: '',
		},
	];
}
```

4. Go to `/packages/nodes-base/package.json`.
5. Paste `""dist/credentials/AutofriendApi.credentials.js"",` in the credentials array to register the credentials (in an alphabetical order).
6. Got to `packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.ts`.
7. Associate the credentials with the node by adding the following to `description.credentials`.

```typescript
 credentials: [
	  {
		  name: 'autofriendApi',
		  required: true,
	  },
],
```

8. Stop the current n8n process by pressing `ctrl + c` in the terminal in which you are running n8n.
9. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal.
```bash
npm run dev
```

When you go to the Node Editor view, you should see the following.

![Autofriend's create credentials](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/autofriend-create-credentials.png)

![Autofriend's credentials](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/autofriend-credentials.png)


## Understanding the life cycle for the webhook method

When a Trigger node is executed either in test or production mode, the following happens:

### n8n persists all the webhooks defined in description.webhooks

The persisted data will be used later to verify if the incoming requests to the n8n's webhook endpoint are valid.

The property webhooks implements the interface **IWebhookDescription**. The interface has four properties.

1. **name:** The property name where n8n will look for the life cycle methods.
2. **httpMethod:** The HTTP method.
3. **responseMode:** When the trigger will respond. When developing a trigger node, this property must be set to `onReceived`.
4. **path:** The path added to the base URL.

For example, for a Trigger node with the following `webhooks` property, n8n will create the following webhooks URLs.

```typescript
webhooks: [
	{
		name: 'default',
		httpMethod: 'POST',
		responseMethod: 'onReceived',
		path: 'webhook',
	},
]
```


- **Test:** POST {{WEBHOOK_URL || localhost}}/webhook-test/{{uuid}}/{{path}}
- **Production:** POST {{WEBHOOK_URL || localhost}}/webhook/{{uuid}}/{{path}}


These URLs can be found in the node under the `Webhook URLs` label.

These webhook URLs will be used as the notification URL (also known as the callback URL or target URL) when creating the webhook in the external system.

**Note:** In test mode, the webhooks are persisted in memory. In production mode, they are persisted in the database.


### n8n executes the life cycle methods

The life cycle methods allow us to create, delete, and check if the webhook exists in the external system.

**Methods**

- `checkExist`: This is the first method that gets called. It checks if the webhook with the current path is already registered in the external system or not. If the webhook is already registered, n8n persists the webhook ID. If the webhook isn't registered with the external system, the `create` method gets executed.
- `create`: This method gets called if the `checkExist` method returns false (if the webhook with the current path doesn'texist in the external system). This method registers the webhook in the external system and stores the webhook ID in n8n.
- `delete`: This method gets called when the trigger is either stopped manually or when the workflow is deactivated. It uses the ID previously persisted by either the create or the checkExist method to delete the webhook from the external system.

![Lifecycle flowchart](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/lifecycle.png)


### Wait for new events to trigger the workflow

Every time the external system notifies us about a change, by making an HTTP Request to the URL we previously registered in the `create` method, the `execute` method is called. Within this method, we have access to the request object and everything it contains. For example, body, headers, querystring, etc. The data the method returns is the data we want the rest of the workflow to have access to.

Let's see how this would look for our current use-case:

1. Go to `packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autofriend`, create a file named `GenericFunctions.ts`, and paste the following code.

```typescript
import {
	IDataObject,
	IExecuteFunctions,
	IHookFunctions,
	ILoadOptionsFunctions,
	IRequestOptions,
	IWebhookFunctions,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export async function autofriendApiRequest(this: IExecuteFunctions | IWebhookFunctions | IHookFunctions | ILoadOptionsFunctions, method: string, resource: string, body: any = {}, query: IDataObject = {}, uri?: string, option: IDataObject = {}): Promise<any> { // tslint:disable-line:no-any

	const credentials = await this.getCredentials('autofriendApi') as IDataObject;

	const apiKey = credentials.apiKey;

	const endpoint = 'https://api2.autopilothq.com/v1';

	const options: IRequestOptions = {
		headers: {
			'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			autopilotapikey: apiKey,
		},
		method,
		body,
		qs: query,
		uri: uri || `${endpoint}${resource}`,
		json: true,
	};
	if (!Object.keys(body).length) {
		delete options.body;
	}
	if (!Object.keys(query).length) {
		delete options.qs;
	}

	try {
		return await this.helpers.request!(options);
	} catch (error) {
		if (error.response) {
			const errorMessage = error.response.body.message || error.response.body.description || error.message;
			throw new Error(`Autopilot error response [${error.statusCode}]: ${errorMessage}`);
		}
		throw error;
	}
}
```

2. Go to `packages/nodes-base/nodes/AutofriendTrigger.node.ts` and add the following code after the property description.

```typescript
// @ts-ignore
webhookMethods = {
	default: {
		async checkExists(this: IHookFunctions): Promise<boolean> {
			const webhookData = this.getWorkflowStaticData('node');
			const webhookUrl = this.getNodeWebhookUrl('default');
			const event = this.getNodeParameter('event') as string;
			const { hooks: webhooks } = await autofriendApiRequest.call(this, 'GET', '/hooks');
			for (const webhook of webhooks) {
				if (webhook.target_url === webhookUrl && webhook.event === snakeCase(event)) {
					webhookData.webhookId = webhook.hook_id;
					return true;
				}
			}
			return false;
		},
		async create(this: IHookFunctions): Promise<boolean> {
			const webhookUrl = this.getNodeWebhookUrl('default');
			const webhookData = this.getWorkflowStaticData('node');
			const event = this.getNodeParameter('event') as string;
			const body: IDataObject = {
				event: snakeCase(event),
				target_url: webhookUrl,
			};
			const webhook = await autofriendApiRequest.call(this, 'POST', '/hook', body);
			webhookData.webhookId = webhook.hook_id;
			return true;
		},
		async delete(this: IHookFunctions): Promise<boolean> {
			const webhookData = this.getWorkflowStaticData('node');
			try {
				await autofriendApiRequest.call(this, 'DELETE', `/hook/${webhookData.webhookId}`);
			} catch (error) {
				return false;
			}
			delete webhookData.webhookId;
			return true;
		},
	},
};
}
```
3. Replace the `webhook` function with the following.
```typescript
async webhook(this: IWebhookFunctions): Promise<IWebhookResponseData> {
	const req = this.getRequestObject();
	return {
		workflowData: [
			this.helpers.returnJsonArray(req.body),
		],
};
```
4. In the same file, uncomment the code snippet on the top to import `autoFriendApiRequest` and `snakeCase`.
5. Stop the current n8n process by pressing `ctrl + c` in the terminal where you are running n8n.
6. Run the project using a tunnel by entering `./packages/cli/bin/n8n start --tunnel` in the terminal. Access the n8n Editor UI at [localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678/workflow).
7. Enter the API key in the credentials. Instructions to find the API Key can be found [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/autopilot/).
8. Go to the workflow editor, save your workflow, and execute the node.

![Executed node](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/executed-node.png)

9. Log into Autopilot and update a contact. Keep in mind that this should be done within two minutes after you executed the node. After that time frame, the webhook will be unregistered automatically and you will not be able to receive the event. If it takes you longer than that, please execute the node and update the contact again.

![Executed node with results](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/executed-node-with-results.png)

The trigger node is now receiving events. Sometimes it might take a bit longer for the payload to arrive.

You probably noticed that this time we did not run the project using `npm run dev`, but instead using `./packages/cli/bin/n8n start --tunnel`.

Since our server is running locally, we need a tool that lets us proxy all requests to our local machine so that n8n receives and handles the events from the external service (Autopilot). This gets achieved using a tunnel. The details on how a tunnel works are out of the scope of this tutorial. If you want to know about it, you can check this [link](http://localtunnel.github.io/www/). Keep in mind that the tunnel is meant for development purposes only and shouldn't be used in production.


## Test your node

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/testing.md""

## Next steps

* [Deploy your node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/).
* View an example of a declarative node: n8n's [Brevo node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo){:target=_blank .external-link}. Note that the main node is declarative, while the trigger node is in programmatic style.
* Learn about [node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/)."
item,"# `$item(index: number, runIndex?: number)`

With `$item` you can access the data of parent nodes. That can be the item data but also
the parameters. It expects as input an index of the item the data should be returned for. This is
needed because for each item the data returned can be different. This is probably straightforward for the
item data itself but maybe less for data like parameters. The reason why it is also needed, is
that they may contain an expression. Expressions get always executed of the context for an item.
If that would not be the case, for example, the Email Send node not would be able to send multiple
emails at once to different people. Instead, the same person would receive multiple emails.

The index is 0 based. So `$item(0)` will return the first item, `$item(1)` the second one, and so on.

By default the item of the last run of the node  will be returned. So if the referenced node ran
3x (its last runIndex is 2) and the current node runs the first time (its runIndex is 0) the
data of runIndex 2 of the referenced node will be returned.

For more information about what data can be accessed via `$node`, check out the `Variable: $node` [section](/code-examples/methods-variables/node/).

Example:

```typescript
// Returns the value of the JSON data property ""myNumber"" of Node ""Set"" (first item)
const myNumber = $item(0).$node[""Set""].json[""myNumber""];
// Like above but data of the 6th item
const myNumber = $item(5).$node[""Set""].json[""myNumber""];

// Returns the value of the parameter ""channel"" of Node ""Slack"".
// If it contains an expression the value will be resolved with the
// data of the first item.
const channel = $item(0).$node[""Slack""].parameter[""channel""];
// Like above but resolved with the value of the 10th item.
const channel = $item(9).$node[""Slack""].parameter[""channel""];
```"
n8n-nodes-base.cron,"# Cron

The Cron node is useful to schedule the workflows to run periodically at fixed dates, times, or intervals. This works in a similar way to the [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) software utility in Unix-like systems. This core node is a Trigger node.

///  note  | Keep in mind
1. If a workflow is using the Cron node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow.
///    2. Make sure that the timezone is set correctly for the n8n instance (or the workflow).



## Node Reference

You can configure the node by clicking on the *Add Cron Time* button under the *Trigger Times* section. There are a couple of different options available for the *Mode* field in the form of a dropdownlist.

- Mode
    - Every Minute
    - Every Hour
    - Every Day
    - Every Week
    - Every Month
    - Every X
    - Custom

The 'Every X' option allows you to specify the workflow to be triggered every x minutes or hours. You can specify x by entering a number in the *Value* field. The 'Custom' option allows you to enter a custom [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression) in the *Cron Expression* field.

## FAQs

### How to generate a custom Cron expression?

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru). Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the ***Cron Expression*** field in n8n.

### Why there are six asterisks (*) in the Cron Expression?

The sixth asterisk in the Cron Expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

| * | * | * | * | * | * |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|second|minute|hour|day|week|month|

If you want to trigger your workflow, for example, every day at 04:08:30, enter the following in the ***Cron Expression*** field.
```
30 8 4 * * *
```

If you want to trigger your workflow, for example, every day at 04:08, enter the following in the ***Cron Expression*** field.
```
8 4 * * *

n8n-nodes-base.function,"# Function

/// warning | Deprecated in 0.198.0
n8n deprecated this node in version 0.198.0. Older workflows continue to work, and the node is still available in older versions n8n. From 0.198.0, n8n replaces the Function node with the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node.
///
Using the function node, you can:

* Transform data from other nodes
* Implement custom functionality

///  note  | Function node and function item node

///

The Function node supports:

* Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
* Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

When working with the Function node, you need to understand the following concepts:

* [Data structure](/data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Function node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
* [Item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work. You need to handle item linking when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

n8n provides built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

* Accessing specific item data
* Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
* Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [methods and variables](/code-examples/methods-variables-reference/) for more information.


## Output items

When using the Function node, you must return data in the format described in [data structure](/data/data-structure/).

This example creates 10 items with the IDs 0 to 9:

```typescript
const newItems = [];

for (let i=0;i<10;i++) {
  newItems.push({
    json: {
      id: i
    }
  });
}

return newItems;
```

## Manage item linking

///

The Function Item node supports promises. So instead of returning the items directly, it is also possible to return a promise which resolves accordingly.

It also provides the ability to write to your browser console using `console.log`, useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.


## Node Reference

You can also use the methods and variables mentioned in the [Expressions](/code-examples/expressions/) page in the Function Item node.

### Variable: item

It contains the ""json"" data of the currently processed item.

The data can be accessed and manipulated like this:

```json
// Uses the data of an already existing key to create a new additional one
item.newIncrementedCounter = item.existingCounter + 1;
return item;
```


### Method: getBinaryData()

Returns all the binary data (all keys) of the item which gets currently processed.
```json
item.filename = getBinaryData().attachment_0.fileName;
return item;
```

### Method: setBinaryData(binaryData)

Sets all the binary data (all keys) of the item which gets currently processed.


### Method: getWorkflowStaticData(type)

This gives access to the static workflow data.
It is possible to save data directly with the workflow. This data should, however, be very small.
A common use case is to for example to save a timestamp of the last item that got processed from
an RSS-Feed or database. It will always return an object. Properties can then read, delete or
set on that object. When the workflow execution succeeds, n8n will check automatically if the data
has changed and will save it, if necessary.

There are two types of static data. The ""global"" and the ""node"" one. Global static data is the
same in the whole workflow. And every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data,
however, is different for every node and only the node which set it can retrieve it again.

**Note:** The static data cannot be read and written when executing via manual executions. The data will always be empty, and the changes will not persist. The static data will only be saved when a workflow is active.


#### Example

```javascript
// Get the global workflow static data
const staticData = getWorkflowStaticData('global');
// Get the static data of the node
const staticData = getWorkflowStaticData('node');

// Access its data

# Retrieval QA Chain

The Retrieval QA Chain node allows you to answer a query based on document content indexed by a retriever.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Retrieval QA Chain node, and links to more resources.

///  note  | Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [LangChain integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/langchain/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.
///	
## Node parameters

### Query

This is the prompt that the model will use.

```
What can you tell me about {{ $json.input }}
```
	
### Choose a mode

There are two modes:

* **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the chain will run once, regardless of how many input items there are.
* **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your chain to run for every input item.

node-developer-cli,"# Using the Node Dev CLI

Using the Node Dev CLI makes sense if you do not want to ever share the node that you create. For example, for internal systems or something very specific to your internal tooling. Also, the CLI only works if there are no additional dependencies required by the node as it does not support installing additional node modules.

If that is not the case, it is best to do follow the [creating your first node](/integrations/creating-nodes/code/create-first-node/) tutorial or create your own custom node-package.

## Create the first basic node

 1. Install the n8n-node-dev CLI: `npm install -g n8n-node-dev`
 1. Create and go into the newly created folder in which you want to keep the code of the node
 1. Use CLI to create boilerplate node code: `n8n-node-dev new`
 1. Answer the questions (the “Execute” node type is the regular node type that you probably want to create).
    It will then create the node in the current folder.
 1. Program… Add the functionality to the node
 1. Build the node and copy to correct location: `n8n-node-dev build`
    That command will build the JavaScript version of the node from the TypeScript code and copy it to the user folder where custom nodes get read from `~/.n8n/custom/`
 1. Restart n8n and refresh the window so that the new node gets displayed


## Create own custom n8n-nodes-module

If you want to create multiple custom nodes which are either:

  - Only for yourself/your company
  - Are only useful for a small number of people
  - Require many or large dependencies

!!! note
    To learn how to develop and test n8n-nodes-module, refer to the [Create n8n-nodes-module](/integrations/creating-nodes/code/create-n8n-nodes-module/) documentation.


It is best to create your own `n8n-nodes-module` which can be installed separately.
That is an npm package that contains the nodes and is set up in a way
that n8n can automatically find and load them on startup.

When creating such a module the following rules have to be followed that n8n
can automatically find the nodes in the module:

  - The name of the module has to start with `n8n-nodes-`
  - The `package.json` file has to contain a key `n8n` with the paths to nodes and credentials
  - The module has to be installed alongside n8n

An example starter module which contains one node and credentials and implements
the above can be found here:

[https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter)


### Setup to use n8n-nodes-module

To use a custom `n8n-nodes-module`, it needs to be installed alongside n8n.
For example like this:

```bash
# Create folder for n8n installation
mkdir my-n8n
cd my-n8n

# Install n8n
npm install n8n

# Install custom nodes module
npm install n8n-nodes-my-custom-nodes

# Start n8n
n8n
```


### Development/Testing of custom n8n-nodes-module

This works in the same way as for any other npm module.

Execute in the folder which contains the code of the custom `n8n-nodes-module`
which should be loaded with n8n:

```bash
# Build the code
npm run build

# ""Publish"" the package locally
npm link
```

Then in the folder in which n8n is installed:

```bash
# ""Install"" the above locally published module
npm link n8n-nodes-my-custom-nodes

# Start n8n
n8n
```"
plan-flow-logic,"---
description: Design your workflow's logic.
---

[TODO: I'm not sure this page is helpful, especially if focused on a dev audience]

# Plan your workflow logic

When you build a workflow, you create a set of instructions for how to process data. This can include:

* Accessing external applications to retrieve and export data. 
* Manipulating data.
* Performing different actions based on the data.


To define your data process, you link nodes together in a sequence. This is your workflow logic. n8n supports complex logic.

///  Details  | What is data?
In n8n, data is any information processed by the workflow. n8n formats data as JSON. Refer to [Data](/data/) for more information on the data structure, and working with n8n workflow data.
///
## Fetch data

Your workflow needs data. There are three main ways to get this data:

* From the trigger node that starts the workflow. For example, if you use the Gmail trigger to start a workflow in response to an event in Gmail, the Gmail trigger node provides data about the event.
* Using an app node to retrieve data. For example, you can use the Gmail node to fetch information from Gmail (after starting the workflow with a different trigger).
* Generate the data within the workflow. For example, you can use the Code node to create data.


## Manipulate data"
review-checklist,"# Node review checklist

This checklist helps you build a node that meets the standards for submission to the community nodes collection. It also helps ensure that nodes are consistent and good quality.

## Preparation

<input type=""checkbox""> Set up your editor for code formatting (indentation, new lines, linting). If you use Visual Studio Code, you can use the [TSLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin){:target=_blank .external-link} for linting.</input> <br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Get credentials (for example, Client ID, Client Secret, API key, user login, user password, website URL) for the service you are building a node for.</input>

## Development

<input type=""checkbox""> If you're creating a node requested by a community member, make sure to comment on the feature request in the [community forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/feature-requests/5){:target=_blank .external-link}.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Add complementary operations to each resource (for example, create, delete)</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Programmatic-style only. Check the node works with more than one input item.</input><br> 
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure the parameters have the correct type.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Mind the defaults: if the service has a default as true, keep it as true. Changing default values can break the existing workflows of the users.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Check if the node disposes of everything. In particular, the node has closed all connections.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Check your code using the [node linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-linter/).</input><br>

## Testing

<input type=""checkbox""> Test ""create"" and ""update"" operations with all fields/operations.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Test the `continueOnFail` option with a Function node. For example, a Widget node has a GET operation that takes a widgetId and returns information on the widget. To test that the workflow continues on fail, set the Widget node to continue on fail, create a Function node, return a valid and an invalid widgetId, connect the Function node to Widget node, and run the workflow. The Widget node should show two items: one with information on the widget and another one with the error from having passed an invalid ID.)</input><br>

## Code formatting

<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure the package lints cleanly by running `npm run lint`.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure the indentation is correct. Check this in the editor configuration.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure there are no extra spaces. Check this in the editor configuration.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Code comment dividers inside if-branches.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Use ""create/delete"" verbs for operations, except for tags, where you should use ""add/remove.""</input><br>

## Errors and outputs

<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure empty API responses return `{ success: true }`.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure the node handles and displays error responses (for example, malformed requests, requests with invalid credentials) and use the current format. You can check this by making failing requests to the API.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Check if you can simplify the response. If so, add a simplify function (for example, [SecurityScorecard node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/SecurityScorecard/GenericFunctions.ts){:target=_blank .external-link}).</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure the response from `Create` is consistent with `Get`.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure the response from `Get All` is consistent with `Get`.</input><br>

## Presentation

<input type=""checkbox""> The primary menu shouldn't contain optional parameters.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure a JSON object isn't shown in a single column in Table view.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Make sure all GetAll operations have the fields `return` and `limit`.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Set the property subtitle.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Make sure the pagination (if any) is working. Set Limit 1.</input><br>

## Writing

<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure all descriptions are correct and end with a period.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure that most descriptions exist, excluding redundant ones.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Capitalize IDs in displayNames (for example: ""IDs"" not ""ids"" or ""Ids"").</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> If there is more than one ID, ensure they have descriptive qualifiers.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure the `name` property in `description` in the node class is in camelCase.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure the file name and the class name are identical.</input><br>

## Branding
<!-- vale off -->
<input type=""checkbox""> Check that brand names are correct (for example, ""GitHub"" not ""Github""). </input><br>
<input type=""checkbox"">If the node is a trigger node, show this in the name by adding ""Trigger"" after the service name (for example, ""Trello Trigger"").</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure the logo is either a PNG or SVG, ideally the latter. [Vecta](https://vecta.io/symbols){:target=_blank .external-link} is a good website to find SVGs of different applications.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> If the logo is an SVG, ensure the canvas is a perfect square. If the logo is PNG, ensure it's 60x60 pixels and compressed.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Ensure the border color of the node matches the branding of the service.</input><br>
<!-- vale on -->

## Nice-to-haves (optional)

<input type=""checkbox""> Add handler for `continueOnFail`. This handler continues the workflow even if the node's execution fails.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> Remove `required: false` and `description: ''` in the node descriptions (for example, [Lemlist node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Lemlist/descriptions){:target=_blank .external-link}).</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> At call site, specify first `body` and then `qs`.</input><br>
<input type=""checkbox""> At call site, prepend the endpoint with slash `/` (for example, ""/campaign"").</input><br>"

# n8n v1.0 migration guide

This document provides a summary of what you should be aware of before updating to version 1.0 of n8n.

The release of n8n 1.0 marks a milestone in n8n's journey to make n8n available for demanding production environments. Version 1.0 represents the hard work invested over the last four years to make n8n the most accessible, powerful, and versatile automation tool. n8n 1.0 is now ready for use in production.

## New features

### Python support in the Code node

Although JavaScript remains the default language, you can now also select Python as an option in the [Code node](/code/code-node/) and even make use of [many Python modules](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide){:target=_blank .external link}. Note that Python is unavailable in Code nodes added to a workflow before v1.0.

[PR #4295](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/4295){:target=_blank .external link}, [PR #6209](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6209){:target=_blank .external link}

### Execution order

n8n 1.0 introduces a new execution order for multi-branch workflows:

In multi-branch workflows, n8n needs to determine the order in which to execute nodes on branches. Previously, n8n executed the first node of each branch, then the second of each branch, and so on (breadth-first). The new execution order ensures that each branch executes completely before starting the next one (depth-first). Branches execute based on their position on the canvas, from top to bottom. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost one executes first.

n8n used to execute multi-input nodes as long as they received data on their first input. Nodes connected to the second input of multi-input nodes automatically executed regardless of whether they received data. The new execution order introduced in n8n 1.0 simplifies this behavior: Nodes are now executed only when they receive data, and multi-input nodes require data on at least one of their inputs to execute.

Your existing workflows will use the legacy order, while new workflows will execute using the v1 order. You can configure the execution order for each workflow in [workflow settings](/workflows/settings/).

[PR #4238](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/4238){:target=_blank .external link}, [PR #6246](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6246){:target=_blank .external link}, [PR #6507](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6507){:target=_blank .external link}

## Deprecations

### MySQL and MariaDB

n8n has removed support for MySQL and MariaDB as storage backends for n8n. These database systems are used by only a few users, yet they require continuous development and maintenance efforts. n8n recommends migrating to PostgreSQL for better compatibility and long-term support.

[PR #6189](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6189){:target=_blank .external link}

### EXECUTIONS_PROCESS and ""own"" mode

Previously, you could use the `EXECUTIONS_PROCESS` environment variable to specify whether executions should run in the `main` process or in their `own` processes. This option and `own` mode are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of n8n. This is because it led to increased code complexity while offering marginal benefits. Starting from n8n 1.0, `main` will be the new default.

Note that executions start much faster in `main` mode than in `own` mode. However, if a workflow consumes more memory than is available, it might crash the entire n8n application instead of just the worker thread. To mitigate this, make sure to allocate enough system resources or configure [queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) to distribute executions among multiple workers.

[PR #6196](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6196){:target=_blank .external link}

## Breaking changes

### Docker

#### Permissions change

When using Docker-based deployments, the n8n process is now run by the user `node` instead of `root`. This change increases security.

If permission errors appear in your n8n container logs when starting n8n, you may need to update the permissions by executing the following command on the Docker host:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --user root -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n --entrypoint chown n8nio/base:16 -R node:node /home/node/.n8n
```

#### Image removal

We've removed the Debian and RHEL images. If you were using these you need to change the image you use. This shouldn't result in any errors unless you were making a custom image based on one of those images.

#### Entrypoint change

The entrypoint for the container has changed and you no longer need to specify the n8n command. If you were previously running `n8n worker --concurrency=5` it's now `worker --concurrency=5`

[PR #6365](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6365){:target=_blank .external link}

### Workflow failures due to expression errors

Workflow executions may fail due to syntax or runtime errors in expressions, such as those that reference non-existent nodes. While expressions already throw errors on the frontend, this change ensures that n8n also throws errors on the backend, where they were previously silently ignored. To receive notifications of failing workflows, n8n recommends setting up an ""error workflow"" under workflow settings.

[PR #6352](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6352){:target=_blank .external link}

### Mandatory owner account

This change makes [User Management](/user-management/) mandatory and removes support for other authentication methods, such as BasicAuth and External JWT. Note that the number of permitted users on [n8n.cloud](http://n8n.cloud/){:target=_blank .external link} or custom plans still varies depending on your subscription.

[PR #6362](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6362){:target=_blank .external link}

### Directory for installing custom nodes

n8n will no longer load custom nodes from its global `node_modules` directory. Instead, you must install (or link) them to `~/.n8n/custom` (or a directory defined by `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`). Custom nodes that are npm packages will be located in `~/.n8n/nodes`.
If you have custom nodes that were linked using `npm link` into the global `node_modules` directory, you need to link them again, into `~/.n8n/nodes` instead.

[PR #6396](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6396){:target=_blank .external link}

### WebSockets

The `N8N_PUSH_BACKEND` environment variable can be used to configure one of two available methods for pushing updates to the user interface: `sse` and `websocket`. Starting with n8n 1.0, `websocket` is the default method.

[PR #6196](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6196){:target=_blank .external link}

### Date transformation functions

n8n provides various transformation functions that operate on dates. These functions may return either a JavaScript `Date` or a Luxon `DateTime` object. With the new behavior, the return type always matches the input. If you call a date transformation function on a `Date`, it returns a `Date`. Similarly, if you call it on a `DateTime` object, it returns a `DateTime` object.

To identify any workflows and nodes that might be impacted by this change, you can use this [utility workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1929-v1-helper-find-params-with-affected-expressions/){:target=_blank .external link}.

For more information about date transformation functions, please refer to the [official documentation](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/).

[PR #6435](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6435){:target=_blank .external link}

### Execution data retention

Starting from n8n 1.0, all successful, failed, and manual workflow executions will be saved by default. These settings can be modified for each workflow under ""Workflow Settings,"" or globally using the respective environment variables. Additionally, the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` setting will be enabled by default, with `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` set to 10,000. These default settings are designed to prevent performance degradation when using SQLite. Make sure to configure them according to your individual requirements and system capacity.

[PR #6577](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6577){:target=_blank .external link}

### Removed N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB

The legacy `request` library has been deprecated for some time now. As of n8n 1.0, the ability to fall back to it in the HTTP Request node by setting the `N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB` environment variable has been fully removed. The HTTP Request node will now always use the new `HttpRequest` interface.

If you build custom nodes, refer to [HTTP request helpers](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/http-helpers/) for more information on migrating to the new interface.

[PR #6413](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6413){:target=_blank .external link}

### Removed WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL

As of version 0.227.0, n8n has renamed the `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` configuration option to `WEBHOOK_URL`. In n8n 1.0, `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` has been removed. Update your setup to reflect the new name. For more information about this configuration option, refer to [the docs](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/).

[PR #1408](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/1408){:target=_blank .external link}

### Remove Node 16 support

n8n now requires Node 18.17.0 or above.

## Updating to n8n 1.0

1. Create a full backup of n8n.
2. n8n recommends updating to the latest n8n 0.x release before updating to n8n 1.x. This will allow you to pinpoint any potential issues to the correct release. Once you have verified that n8n 0.x starts up without any issues, proceed to the next step.
3. Carefully read the [Deprecations](#deprecations) and [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) sections above to assess how they may affect your setup.
4. Update to n8n 1.0:
	* During beta (before July 24th 2023): If using Docker, pull the `next` Docker image.
	* After July 24th 2023: If using Docker, pull the `latest` Docker image.
5. If you encounter any issues, redeploy the previous n8n version and restore the backup.

## Reporting issues

If you encounter any issues during the process of updating to n8n 1.0, please seek help in the community [forum](https://community.n8n.io/){:target=_blank .external link}.

contentType: howto
---

# Enterprise license key

You need to add your enterprise license key to enable enterprise features. You can do this through the UI, or using environment variables.

## Add an enterprise license key in the UI

In your n8n instance:

1. Select **Settings** > **Usage and plan**.
1. Select **Enter activation key**.
1. Paste in your license key.
1. Select **Activate**.

## Add an enterprise license key using environment variables

In your n8n configuration, set `N8N_LICENSE_ACTIVATION_KEY` to your license key.

Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) to learn more about configuring n8n.

## Allowlist the license server IP addresses

n8n uses Cloudflare to host the license server. As the specific IP addresses can change, you need to allowlist the [full range of Cloudflare IPs](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/){:target=_blank .external-link} to ensure n8n can always reach the license server."

# External secrets

/// info | Feature availability
* External secrets are available on Enterprise Self-hosted and Enterprise Cloud plans.
* n8n supports AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secrets Manager, Infisical and HashiCorp Vault. 
* n8n doesn't support [HashiCorp Vault Secrets](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault-secrets){:target=_blank .external-link}.
///

You can use an external secrets store to manage credentials for n8n.

n8n stores all credentials encrypted in its database, and restricts access to them by default. With the external secrets feature, you can store sensitive credential information in an external vault, and have n8n load it in when required. This provides an extra layer of security and allows you to manage credentials used across multiple [n8n environments](/source-control-environments/) in one central place.

## Connect n8n to your secrets store

/// note | Secret names
Your secret names can't contain spaces, hyphens, or other special characters. n8n supports secret names containing alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, and `0-9`), and underscores.
///
1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **External Secrets**.
1. Select **Set Up** for your store provider.
1. Enter the credentials for your provider:
	* Azure Key Vault: Provide your **vault name**, **tenant ID**, **client ID**, and **client secret**. Refer to the Azure documentation to [register a Microsoft Entra ID app and create a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal){:target=_blank .external-link}. n8n supports only single-line values for secrets.
	* AWS Secrets Manager: provide your **access key ID**, **secret access key**, and **region**. The IAM user must have the `secretsmanager:ListSecrets` and `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue` permissions.

		Example policy:
		```json
		{
			""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
			""Statement"": [
				{
					""Sid"": ""VisualEditor0"",
					""Effect"": ""Allow"",
					""Action"": [
						""secretsmanager:ListSecrets"",
						""secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue"",
 						""secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy"",
						""secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"",
						""secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"",
						""secretsmanager:ListSecretVersionIds"",
					],
					""Resource"": ""*""
				}
			]
		}
		```

	* HashiCorp Vault: provide the **Vault URL** for your vault instance, and select your **Authentication Method**.  Enter your authentication details. Optionally provide a namespace.
		- Refer to the HashiCorp documentation for your authentication method:
				[Token auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/token){:target=_blank .external-link}  
				[AppRole auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/approle){:target=_blank .external-link}  
				[Userpass auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/userpass){:target=_blank .external-link}  
		- If you use vault namespaces, you can enter the namespace n8n should connect to. Refer to [Vault Enterprise namespaces](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on HashiCorp Vault namespaces.

	* Infisical: provide a **Service Token**. Refer to Infisical's [Service token](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/token){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for information on getting your token. If you self-host Infisical, enter the **Site URL**.

	    /// note | Infisical environment
		Make sure you select the correct Infisical environment when creating your token. n8n will load secrets from this environment, and won't have access to secrets in other Infisical environments. n8n only support service tokens that have access to a single environment.
		///

	    /// note | Infisical folders
	 	n8n doesn't support [Infisical folders](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/folder){:target=_blank .external-link}.
		///

	* Google Cloud Platform: provide a **Service Account Key** (JSON) for a service account that has at least these roles: `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` and `Secret Manager Secret Viewer`. Refer to Google's [service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

1. **Save** your configuration.
1. Enable the provider using the **Disabled / Enabled** toggle.


## Use secrets in n8n credentials

To use a secret from your store in an n8n credential:

1. Create a new credential, or open an existing one.
1. On the field where you want to use a secret:
	1. Hover over the field.
	1. Select **Expression**.
1. In the field where you want to use a secret, enter an expression referencing the secret name:
	```js
	{{ $secrets.<vault-name>.<secret-name> }}
	```
	`<vault-name>` is either `vault` (for HashiCorp) or `infisical` or `awsSecretsManager`. Replace `<secret-name>` with the name as it appears in your vault.

## Using external secrets with n8n environments

n8n's [Source control and environments](/source-control-environments/) feature allows you to create different n8n environments, backed by Git. The feature doesn't support using different credentials in different instances. You can use an external secrets vault to provide different credentials for different environments by connecting each n8n instance to a different vault or project environment.

For example, you have two n8n instances, one for development and one for production. You use Infisical for your vault. In Infisical, create a project with two environments, development and production. Generate a token for each Infisical environment. Use the token for the development environment to connect your development n8n instance, and the token for your production environment to connect your production n8n instance.

## Using external secrets in projects

To use external secrets in an [RBAC project](/user-management/rbac/), you must have an [instance owner or instance admin](/user-management/account-types/) as a member of the project.

## Troubleshooting

### Infisical version changes

Infisical version upgrades can introduce problems connecting to n8n. If your Infisical connection stops working, check if there was a recent version change. If so, report the issue to help@n8n.io.

### Only set external secrets on credentials owned by an instance owner or admin

Due to the permissions that instance owners and admins have, it's possible for owners and admins to update credentials owned by another user with a secrets expression. This will appear to work in preview for an instance owner or admin, but the secret won't resolve when the workflow runs in production. 

Only use external secrets for credentials that are owned by an instance admin or owner. This ensures they resolve correctly in production."

**Release date:** 2024-12-04

This release contains node updates, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

### Task runners for the Code node in public beta
We're introducing a significant performance upgrade to the Code node with our new Task runner system. This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation.

<figure markdown=""span"">
    ![Task runners overview](/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-concept.png)
    <figcaption>Task runners overview</figcaption>
</figure>

Our benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same.

The Task runner comes in two modes:

- Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes  
- External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security

Currently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/). Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.

To start using Task runners today, [check out the docs](/hosting/configuration/task-runners/).

### New canvas in beta
The new canvas is now the default setting for all users. It should bring significant performance improvements and adds a handy minimap. As it is still a beta version you can still revert to the previous version with the three dot menu.  

We're looking forward to your feedback. Should you encounter a bug, you will find a handy button to create an issue at the bottom of the new canvas as well. 

### Node updates
- We added credential support for [Zabbix](/integrations/builtin/credentials/zabbix/) to the HTTP request node  
- We added new OAuth2 credentials for [Microsoft SharePoint](/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft/)
- The [Slack node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/#operations) now uses markdown for the approval message when using the `Send and Wait for Approval` operation

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

### New node: n8n Form
Use the [n8n Form node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/) to create user-facing forms with multiple pages. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. Start the workflow with a [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). 

<figure markdown=""span"">
    ![A multi-page form with branching](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/example_image.png)
    <figcaption>A multi-page form with branching</figcaption>
</figure>

Additionally you can: 

- Set default selections with query parameters  
- Define the form with a JSON array of objects
- Show a completion screen and redirect to another URL

</div>

### Node updates
New nodes: 

- [Google Business Profile](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofile/) and [Google Business Profile Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofiletrigger/): Use these to integrate Google Business Profile reviews and posts with your workflows  

Enhanced nodes:

- [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): Removed the requirement to add at least one tool  
- [GitHub](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/): Added workflows as a resource operation  
- [Structured Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/): Added more user-friendly error messages

For additional security, we improved how we handle multi-factor authentication, hardened config file permissions and introduced JWT for the public API. 

For better performance, we improved how partial executions are handled in loops.

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

### Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates
The [Remove Duplicates node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations: 

- Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates  
- Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

This makes it easier to only process new items from any data source. For example, you can now more easily poll a Google sheet for new entries by `id` or remove duplicate orders from the same customer by comparing their `order date`. The great thing is, you can now do this within **and across** workflow runs. 

</div>

### New node: Gong
  
The new node for [Gong](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gong/) allows you to get users and calls to process them further in n8n. Very useful for sales related workflows.

/// warning | [Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md){:target=_blank .external-link}
What changed?

- The worker server used to bind to IPv6 by default. It now binds to IPv4 by default.  
- The worker server's `/healthz` used to report healthy status based on database and Redis checks. It now reports healthy status regardless of database and Redis status, and the database and Redis checks are part of `/healthz/readiness`.  

When is action necessary?

- If you experience a port conflict error when starting a worker server using its default port, set a different port for the worker server with `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`.  
- If you are relying on database and Redis checks for worker health status, switch to checking `/healthz/readiness` instead of `/healthz`.  
///

This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.

### Node updates

- [OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/): Added the option to choose between the default memory connector to provide memory to the assistant or to specify a thread ID    
- [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) and [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/): Added custom approval operations to have a human in the loop of a workflow  

We have also optimized the [worker health checks](/hosting/logging-monitoring/monitoring/) (see breaking change above). 

Each credential now has a seperate url you can link to. This makes sharing much easier.

#### Additional nodes as tools

We have made additional nodes usable with the [Tools AI Agent node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/). 
<br /><br />

<video src=""/_video/release-notes/nodes-as-tools.mp4"" controls width=""100%""></video>
<br /><br />
Additionally, we have added a `$fromAI()` placeholder function to use with tools, allowing you to dynamically pass information from the models to the connected tools. This function works similarly to placeholders used elsewhere in n8n. 
<br /><br />
Both of these new features enable you to build even more powerful AI agents by drawing directly from the apps your business uses. This makes integrating LLMs into your business processes even easier than before. 

</div>

### Node updates

- [Google BigQuery](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebigquery/): Added option to return numeric values as integers and not strings

Drag and drop insertion on cursor position from schema view is now also enabled for code, SQL and Html fields in nodes. 

Customers with an enterprise license can now rate, tag and highlight execution data in the executions view. To use highlighting, add an [Execution Data Node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) (or Code node) to the workflow to set [custom executions data](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).

#### Queue metrics for workers

You can now [expose and consume metrics from your workers](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/). The worker instances have the same metrics available as the main instance(s) and can be configured with [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/).

</div>

You can now customize the maximum file size when uploading files within forms to webhooks. The [environment variable to set](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/) for this is `N8N_FORMDATA_FILE_SIZE_MAX`. The default setting is 200MiB.

**Release date:** 2024-08-28

This release contains new features and bug fixes.

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

#### Improved execution queue handling

We are [exposing new execution queue metrics](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/) to give users more visibility of the queue length. This helps to inform decisions on horizontal scaling, based on queue status. We have also made querying executions faster.

</div>

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

#### New credentials for the HTTP Request node

We added credential support for Datadog, Dynatrace, Elastic Security, Filescan, Iris, and Malcore to the HTTP Request node making it easier to use existing credentials.

</div>


We also made it easier to select workflows as tools when working with AI agents by implementing a new `workflow selector` parameter type.

/// warning | Breaking change
Calling `$(...).last()` (or `(...).first()` or `$(...).all()`) without arguments now returns the last item (or first or all items) of the output that connects two nodes. Previously, it returned the item/items of the first output of that node. Refer to the [breaking changes log](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#1470){:target=_blank .external-link} for details.

/// note | Backup recommended
Although this release doesn't include a breaking change, it is a significant update including database migrations. n8n recommends backing up your data before updating to this version.
///

/// Note | Credential sharing required for manual executions
Instance owners and admins: you will see changes if you try to manually execute a workflow where the credentials aren't shared with you. Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to [share the credential](/credentials/credential-sharing/) with you.
///

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

#### New feature: Projects

With projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team.
<br /><br />
Refer to the [RBAC](/user-management/rbac/) documentation for information on creating projects and using roles.
<br /><br />
The number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to [Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/){:target=_blank .external-link} for details.

#### New node: Slack Trigger

This release adds a trigger node for Slack. Refer to the [Slack Trigger documentation](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) for details.

</div>

### Other highlights

* Improved [memory support for OpenAI assistants](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/#using-memory-with-openai-assistants).

### Rolling back to a previous version

If you update to this version, then decide you need to role back:

Self-hosted n8n:

1. Delete any RBAC projects you created.
2. Revert the database migrations using `n8n db:revert`.

Cloud: contact [help@n8n.io](mailto:help@n8n.io).

#### New feature: Ask AI in the HTTP node

You can now ask AI to help create API requests in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Ask AI**.
1. Enter the **Service** and **Request** you want to use. For example, to use the NASA API to get their picture of the day, enter `NASA` in **Service** and `get picture of the day` in **Request**.
1. Check the parameters: the AI tries to fill them out, but you may still need to adjust or correct the configuration.

Self-hosted users need to [enable AI features and provide their own API keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/ai/)

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

#### New nodes and improved experience for working with files

This release includes a major overhaul of nodes relating to files (binary data).

There are now three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:

- [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
- [Convert to File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
- [Extract From File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

n8n has moved support for iCalendar, PDF, and spreadsheet formats into these nodes, and removed the iCalendar, Read PDF, and Spreadsheet File nodes. There are still standalone nodes for [HTML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) and [XML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).

</div>

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

## LangChain in n8n (beta)

**Release date:** 2023-10-04

This release introduces support for building with LangChain in n8n.

With n8n's LangChain nodes you can build AI-powered functionality within your workflows. The LangChain nodes are configurable, meaning you can choose your preferred agent, LLM, memory, and other components. Alongside the LangChain nodes, you can connect any n8n node as normal: this means you can integrate your LangChain logic with other data sources and services.

Read more:

* This is a beta release, and not yet available in the main product. Follow the instructions in [Access LangChain in n8n](/langchain/access-langchain/) to try it out. Self-hosted and Cloud options are available.
* Learn how LangChain concepts map to n8n nodes in [LangChain concepts in n8n](/langchain/langchain-n8n/).
* Browse n8n's new [Cluster nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/). This is a new set of node types that allows for multiple nodes to work together to configure each other.
* If you want to take a look at the code, it's available on the [ai-beta](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/ai-beta){:target=_blank .external-link} in the n8n repository. Note that it may move in the future.

# Sustainable Use License

/// note | Proprietary licenses for Enterprise
Proprietary licenses are available for enterprise customers. [Get in touch](mailto:license@n8n.io) for more information.
///

n8n's [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md){:target=\_blank .external-link} and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md){:target=\_blank .external-link} are based on the [fair-code](http://faircode.io) model.

## License FAQs

### What license do you use?

n8n uses the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md){:target=_blank .external-link}. These licenses are based on the [fair-code](http://faircode.io) model.


### What source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License? 

The [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) applies to all our source code hosted in our [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) except:

* Content of branches other than master.
* Source code files that contain `.ee.` in their file name. These are licensed under the [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md){:target=_blank .external-link}.

### What is the Sustainable Use License?

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by n8n in 2022. You can read more about why we did this [here](#why-did-you-create-a-license). The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three limitations:

* You may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use.
* You may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes.
* You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law.

We encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. Contact us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io) if you would like to ask any questions about it. 


### What is and isn't allowed under the license in the context of n8n's product?

Our license restricts use to ""internal business purposes"". In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are selling a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from n8n functionality. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed:

* White-labeling n8n and offering it to your customers for money.
* Hosting n8n and charging people money to access it.

All of the following examples are allowed under our license: 

* Using n8n to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database.
* Creating an n8n node for your product or any other integration between your product and n8n.
* Providing consulting services related to n8n, for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to n8n, or code that gets executed by n8n.
* Supporting n8n, for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server.

#### Can I use n8n to act as the back-end to power a feature in my app?

Usually yes, as long as the back-end process doesn't use users' own credentials to access their data.

Here are two examples to clarify:

##### Example 1: Sync ACME app with HubSpot

Bob sets up n8n to collect a user's HubSpot credentials to sync data in the ACME app with data in HubSpot.

<span style=""color: #BF2F51;"">**NOT ALLOWED**</span> under the Sustainable Use License. This use case collects the user's own HubSpot credentials to pull information to feed into the ACME app.

##### Example 2: Embed AI chatbot in ACME app

Bob sets up n8n to embed an AI chatbot within the ACME app. The AI chatbot's credentials in n8n use Bob's company credentials. ACME app end-users only enter their questions or queries to the chatbot.

<span style=""color: #1C9985;"">**ALLOWED**</span> under the Sustainable Use License. No user credentials are being collected.

### What if I want to use n8n for something that's not permitted by the license?

You must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed n8n within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to n8n for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use n8n Embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it [here](https://n8n.io/embed). 

If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Why don't you use an open source license?

n8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make n8n as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs, and provide reliable software at scale long-term.

### Why did you create a license?

Creating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license:

1. By using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible.
2. By promoting [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours.

Our goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were:

1. To be as permissive as possible.
2. Safeguarding our ability to build a business.
3. Being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not.

### My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use – can I still use n8n?

Provided you are using n8n for internal business purposes, and not making n8n available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use n8n. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).


### What happens to the code I contribute to n8n in light of the Sustainable Use License?

Any code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's [terms of use](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#d-user-generated-content). In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms.

n8n asks every contributor to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).

It's easy to get started contributing code to n8n [here](https://github.com/n8n-io), and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community [here](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/contributing.html).


### Why did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?

n8n was licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause until 17 March 2022. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license.

However, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that's open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from n8n, so we wanted to remove this restriction.

We created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure n8n gets the funding needed to build and improve our product.

### What are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?

There are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to ""sell"" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether.

That means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building n8n workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of n8n experts providing these services, you can learn more here.

### Is n8n open source?

Although n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), open source licenses can't include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, n8n offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source.

We coined the term ['fair-code'](https://faircode.io/) as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code.

### What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it?

Fair-code isn't a software license. It describes a software model where software:

* Is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody.
* Has its source code openly available.
* Can be extended by anybody in public and private communities.
* Is commercially restricted by its authors.

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it and see other examples of fair-code licenses [here](https://faircode.io/).

We're always excited to talk about software licenses, fair-code, and other principles around sharing code with interested parties. To get in touch to chat, email [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Can I use n8n's Sustainable Use License for my own project?

Yes! We're excited to see more software use the Sustainable Use License. We'd love to hear about your project if you're using our license: [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

# Tutorial: Build an AI workflow in n8n

This tutorial introduces LangChain functionality in n8n. You can work through it with no prior knowledge of LangChain, AI, or n8n. However, if you've never used n8n before, you should also do the [Longer quickstart](/try-it-out/longer-introduction/), which introduces key n8n concepts.

![""Screenshot of the workflow""](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-tutorial-outcome.png)

In this tutorial you will:

* Create a workflow from scratch. It uses the Chat Trigger to simulate and test chat interactions, ChatGPT to power the chat functionality, and a custom tool to connect to other n8n workflows.
* Understand key concepts, including:
	* The role of agents, models, and tools when building AI functionality.
	* Cluster nodes in n8n: groups of root and sub-node.
	* Loading your own data into AI workflows.

## Step one: Sign up for n8n

--8<-- ""_snippets/try-it-out/install-run-n8n.md""

/// note | n8n version 1.21.0 or above
This tutorial requires n8n version 1.21.0 or above.
///

## Step two: Create a new workflow

--8<-- ""_snippets/try-it-out/new-workflow.md""

## Step three: Add a trigger node

A trigger node starts a workflow. For this tutorial, use the [Chat Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/). This provides a chat interface that you can use to test the workflow.

1. Select **Add first step**.
1. Search for **Chat Trigger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
1. Select **Chat Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
1. Close the node details view to return to the canvas.

## Step four: Add an agent

An agent takes an input, such as a user query, then uses a collection of tools to respond. In n8n the AI Agent node is a root node: a node whose behavior you can configure using sub-nodes.

??? Details ""Cluster nodes: root and sub-nodes""
	--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/cluster-nodes-summary.md""

1. Select the **Add node** <span class=""inline-image"">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector. n8n opens the nodes panel.
1. Search for **Agent**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
1. Select **AI Agent**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
1. Close the node details view to return to the canvas.

## Step five: Chat functionality

To provide chat interactions, the workflow needs:

* A chat model, to process chat inputs and generate responses.
* Memory, so that the workflow can remember and use previous sections of the chat.

Use the connectors on the bottom of the AI Agent node to connect the following:

* **Model**: OpenAI Chat Model. 
	Set up the credentials for this node.

	??? Details ""Credential setup steps""
		1. Create an account with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}. 
		1. [Create API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys){:target=_blank .external-link}. 
		1. In the OpenAI Chat Model node, select **Credential to connect with** > **Create New Credential** to open the credential modal.
		1. Paste the API key into **API Key**.
		1. Select **Save**. n8n tests the connection and confirms if the key is working.
		1. Close the credential modal.

* **Memory**: Window Buffer Memory


## Step six: Get data from another n8n workflow

One unique feature of AI in n8n is the ability to pull in data from other n8n workflows using the [Custom n8n Workflow Tool node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/). This means you can:

* Load your own custom data
* Create custom functionality in another workflow

Because n8n can connect to any service with a public API, this is a powerful tool.

This example generates some fake data in a workflow, and loads it in to the AI workflow. The AI workflow passes a parameter to the workflow generating the data, to ensure it only returns data that's intended to be public.

1. Create a new workflow, then copy in this workflow JSON:
	```json
	{
		""name"": ""Workflow tool example"",
		""nodes"": [
			{
			""parameters"": {
				""jsCode"": ""return [{\""fruit\"": \""apple\"", \""color\"": \""green\"", \""dataPrivacyLevel\"": \""public\""},{\""fruit\"": \""banana\"", \""color\"": \""yellow\"", \""dataPrivacyLevel\"": \""public\""},{\""fruit\"": \""tomato\"", \""color\"": \""red\"", \""dataPrivacyLevel\"": \""private\""}]""

					}
				]
				}
			},
			""id"": ""eb479841-8099-4537-b89b-4b9867446688"",

			""id"": ""1ec54b09-7533-4280-8bf2-54407d6bf134"",
			""name"": ""Execute Workflow Trigger"",
			""type"": ""n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger"",
			""typeVersion"": 1,
			""position"": [
				1000,
				500
			]
			}
		],
		""pinData"": {},
		""connections"": {
			""Code"": {
			""main"": [
				[
				{
					""node"": ""Filter"",
					""type"": ""main"",
					""index"": 0
				}
				]
			]
			},
			""Filter"": {
			""main"": [
				[
				{
					""node"": ""Aggregate"",
					""type"": ""main"",
					""index"": 0
				}
				]
			]
			},
			""Execute Workflow Trigger"": {
			""main"": [
				[
				{
					""node"": ""Code"",
					""type"": ""main"",
					""index"": 0
				}
				]
			]
			}
		}
	}
	```
	The workflow uses the Code node to generate a sample data set, containing a list of fruits, their colors, and whether this information should be public or private.
1. Copy the workflow ID from workflow URL. The ID is the group of random numbers and letters at the end of the URL.
1. In the AI workflow, select the **Tool** output on the **AI Agent**. n8n opens the nodes panel.
1. Select **Custom n8n Workflow Tool**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
1. Configure the node parameters:
	* **Name**: `Fruit`
	* **Description**: `Call this tool to get a list of fruit.`
	* **Workflow ID**: Paste in the workflow ID that you copied from the example workflow URL.
	* **Field to Return**: `data`. This is the name of the item created in the Aggregate node in the example workflow.
1. Select **Add Value** in **Workflow Values** to pass information to the workflow you're calling. Configure the value as follows:
	* **Name**: `visibility`
	* **Type**: String
	* **Value**: `public`

	n8n makes this value available to the workflow in the output data of the trigger node in the workflow you're calling. In this example, to access the value in an expression, use `{{ $('Execute Workflow Trigger').item.json.visibility }}`. You can see this in practice in the Filter node in the sample workflow.

## Step seven: Test the workflow

You can now try out the workflow: close any open nodes, then select **Chat** to start talking with the AI. Ask `Please give me a list of fruits`. The AI Agent node executes the workflow you specified in **Workflow ID**, passing in the value of `visibility` from the **Workflow Values** field. The workflow generates some sample data, filters it to remove any items that aren't set to `public`, and returns the resulting data.

# Demonstration of key differences between agents and chains

In this workflow you can choose whether your chat query goes to an agent or chain. It shows some of the ways that agents are more powerful than chains.

[[ workflowDemo(""file:///advanced-ai/examples/agents_vs_chains.json"") ]]

## Key features

This workflow uses:

* [Chat Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/): start your workflow and respond to user chat interactions. The node provides a customizable chat interface.
* [Switch node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/): directs your query to either the agent or chain, depending on which you specify in your query. If you say ""agent"" it sends it to the agent. If you say ""chain"" it sends it to the chain.
* [Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): the Agent node interacts with other components of the workflow and makes decisions about what tools to use.
* [Basic LLM Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/): the Basic LLM Chain node supports chatting with a connected LLM, but doesn't support memory or tools.

contentType: explanation

# What's an agent in AI?

One way to think of an agent is as a [chain](/advanced-ai/examples/understand-chains/) that knows how to make decisions. Where a chain follows a predetermined sequence of calls to different AI components, an agent uses a language model to determine which actions to take.

Agents are the part of AI that act as decision-makers. They can interact with other agents and tools. When you send a query to an agent, it tries to choose the best tools to use to answer. Agents adapt to your specific queries, as well as the prompts that configure their behavior.

## Agents in n8n

n8n provides one Agent node, which can act as different types of agent depending on the settings you choose. Refer to the [Agent node documentation](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) for details on the available agent types.

When execute a workflow containing an agent, the agent runs multiple times. For example, it may do an initial setup, followed by a run to call a tool, then another run to evaluate the tool response and respond to the user."

# What's a chain in AI?

Chains bring together different components of AI to create a cohesive system. They set up a sequence of calls between the components. These components can include models and memory (though note that in n8n chains can't use memory).


## Chains in n8n

n8n provides three chain nodes:

* [Basic LLM Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/): use to interact with an LLM, without any additional components.
* [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): can connect to a vector store using a retriever, or to an n8n workflow using the Workflow Retriever node. Use this if you want to create a workflow that supports asking questions about specific documents.
* [Summarization Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainsummarization/): takes an input and returns a summary.

There's an important difference between chains in n8n and in other tools such as LangChain: none of the chain nodes support memory. This means they can't remember previous user queries. If you use LangChain to code an AI application, you can give your application memory. In n8n, if you need your workflow to support memory, use an agent. This is essential if you want users to be able to have a natural ongoing conversation with your app."

contentType: explanation

# What's memory in AI?

Memory is a key part of AI chat services. The memory keeps a history of previous messages, allowing for an ongoing conversation with the AI, rather than every interaction starting fresh.

## AI memory in n8n

To add memory to your AI workflow you can use either:

* [Window Buffer Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/): stores a customizable length of chat history for the current session. This is the easiest to get started with.
* One of the memory services that n8n provides nodes for. These include:
	* [Motorhead](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymotorhead/)
	* [Redis Chat Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryredischat/)
	* [Postgres Chat Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorypostgreschat/) 
	* [Xata](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryxata/)
	* [Zep](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryzep/)

If you need to do advanced AI memory management in your workflows, use the [Chat Memory Manager](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node.

# What's a tool in AI?

In AI, 'tools' has a specific meaning. Tools act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.

Here are a couple of other ways of expressing it:

> Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world ([source](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/){:target=_blank .external-link})

<!--  -->

> We can think of these tools as being almost like functions that your AI model can call ([source](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-and-langchain-the-complete-developers-masterclass/){:target=_blank .external-link})

## AI tools in n8n

n8n provides tool sub-nodes that you can connect to your AI agent. As well as providing some popular tools, such as [Wikipedia](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolwikipedia/) and [SerpAPI](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolserpapi/), n8n provides three especially powerful tools:

* [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): use this to load any n8n workflow as a tool.
* [Custom Code Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/): write code that your agent can run.
* [HTTP Request Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/): make calls to fetch a website or data from an API.

The next three examples highlight the Custom n8n Workflow Tool:

- [Chat with Google Sheets](/advanced-ai/examples/data-google-sheets/)
- [Call an API to fetch data](/advanced-ai/examples/api-workflow-tool/)
- [Set up a human fallback](/advanced-ai/examples/human-fallback/)

This enables fast and accurate similarity searches. With a vector database, instead of using conventional database queries, you can search for relevant data based on semantic and contextual meaning.

## A simplified example

A vector database could store the sentence ""n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host"", but instead of storing it as text, the vector database stores an array of dimensions (numbers between 0 and 1) that represent its features. This doesn't mean turning each letter in the sentence into a number. Instead, the vectors in the vector database describe the sentence. 

Suppose that in a vector store `0.1` represents `automation tool`, `0.2` represents `source available`, and `0.3` represents `can be self-hosted`. You could end up with the following vectors:

| Sentence | Vector (array of dimensions) |
| -------- | ------ |
| n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host | [0.1, 0.2, 0.3] |
| Zapier is an automation tool | [0.1] |
| Make is an automation tool | [0.1] |
| Confluence is a wiki tool that you can self-host | [0.3] |

/// note | This example is very simplified
In practice, vectors are far more complex. A vector can range in size from tens to thousands of dimensions. The dimensions don't have a one-to-one relationship to a single feature, so you can't translate individual dimensions directly into single concepts. This example gives an approximate mental model, not a true technical understanding.
///


## Demonstrating the power of similarity search

Qdrant provide [vector search demos](https://qdrant.tech/demo/){:target=_blank .external-link} to help users understand the power of vector databases. The [food discovery demo](https://food-discovery.qdrant.tech/){:target=_blank .external-link} shows how a vector store can help match pictures based on visual similarities.

> This demo uses data from Delivery Service. Users may like or dislike the photo of a dish, and the app will recommend more similar meals based on how they look. It's also possible to choose to view results from the restaurants within the delivery radius. ([source](https://qdrant.tech/demo/){:target=_blank .external-link})

For full technical details, refer to the [Qdrant demo-food-discovery GitHub repository](https://github.com/qdrant/demo-food-discovery){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Embeddings, retrievers, text splitters, and document loaders

Vector databases require other tools to function:

- Document loaders and text splitters: document loaders pull in documents and data, and prepare them for embedding. Document loaders can use text splitters to break documents into chunks.
- Embeddings: these are the tools that turn the data (text, images, and so on) into vectors, and back into raw data. Note that n8n only supports text embeddings.
- Retrievers: retrievers fetch documents from vector databases. You need to pair them with an embedding to translate the vectors back into data."

# Let AI specify tool parameters with `$fromAI()`

When configuring [app node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) tools connected to the Tools Agent, you can use the `$fromAI()` function to dynamically populate parameter values using the AI model. The AI model will fill in appropriate data given the context from the task and information from other connected tools.

## How the `$fromAI()` function works

The `$fromAI()` function uses AI to dynamically fill in parameters for tools connected to the [Tools AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).  You can use the `$fromAI()` function in expressions within [app nodes](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) (like [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/), [Notion](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/), or [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/)) connected to a tool node.

/// note | Only for the Node Tools
The `$fromAI()` function is only available for [app node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) tools connected to the Tools Agent. It isn't possible to use the `$fromAI()` function with the [Call n8n Workflow](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/), [Code](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/), [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/), or [other cluster sub-nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/).
///

To use the `$fromAI()` function, call it with the required `key` parameter:

```javascript
{{ $fromAI('email') }}
```

The `key` parameter and other arguments to the `$fromAI()` function aren't references to existing values. Instead, think of these arguments as hints that the AI model will use to populate the right data.

For instance, if you choose a key called `email`, the AI Model will look for an email address in its context, other tools, and input data. In chat workflows, it may ask the user for an email address if it can't find one elsewhere. You can optionally pass other parameters like `description` to give extra context to the AI model.

## Parameters

The `$fromAI()` function accepts the following parameters:

<!-- vale off -->

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `key` | string | :white_check_mark: | A string representing the key or name of the argument. This must be between 1 and 64 characters in length and can only contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. |
| `description` | string | :x: | A string describing the argument. |
| `type` | string | :x: | A string specifying the data type. Can be string, number, boolean, or json (defaults to string). |
| `defaultValue` | any | :x: | The default value to use for the argument. |

<!-- vale on -->

## Examples

As an example, you could use the following `$fromAI()` expression to dynamically populate a field with a name:

```javascript
$fromAI(""name"", ""The commenter's name"", ""string"", ""Jane Doe"")
```

If you don't need the optional parameters, you could simplify this as:

```javascript
$fromAI(""name"")
```

To dynamically populate the number of items you have in stock, you could use a `$fromAI()` expression like this:

```javascript
$fromAI(""numItemsInStock"", ""Number of items in stock"", ""number"", 5)
```

## Templates

You can see the `$fromAI()` function in action in the following templates:

# Populate a Pinecone vector database from a website

Use n8n to scrape a website, load the data into Pinecone, then query it using a chat workflow. This workflow uses the [HTTP node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get website data, extracts the relevant content using the [HTML node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/), then uses the [Pinecone Vector Store node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepinecone/) to send it to Pinecone. 

[[ workflowDemo(""file:///advanced-ai/examples/populate_a_pinecone_vector_database_from_a_website.json"") ]]

## Key features

This workflow uses:

* [HTTP node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): fetches website data.
* [HTML node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/): simplifies the data by extracting the main content from the page.
* [Pinecone Vector Store node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepinecone/) and [Embeddings OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsopenai/): transform the data into vectors and store it in Pinecone.
* [Chat Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) and [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) to query the vector database.

# Use LangSmith with n8n

[LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith){:target=_blank .external-link} is a developer platform created by the LangChain team. You can connect your n8n instance to LangSmith to record and monitor runs in n8n, just as you can in a LangChain application.

/// info | Feature availability
Self-hosted n8n only.
///

## Connect your n8n instance to LangSmith

1. [Log in to LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/settings){:target=_blank .external-link} and get your API key.
1. Set the LangSmith environment variables:

	| Variable | Value |
	| -------- | ----- |
	| LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT | `""https://api.smith.langchain.com""` |
	| LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 | `true` |
	| LANGCHAIN_API_KEY | Set this to your API key |

	Set the variables so that they're available globally in the environment where you host your n8n instance. You can do this in the same way as the rest of your general configuration. These aren't n8n environment variables, so don't try to set them using the [n8n configuration file](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/#set-environment-variables-using-a-file).

1. Restart n8n.

For information on using LangSmith, refer to [LangSmith's documentation](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}."

# API authentication

n8n uses API keys to authenticate API calls.

## Create an API key

1. Log in to n8n.
2. Go to **Settings** > **n8n API**.
3. Select **Create an API key**.
4. Copy **My API Key** and use this key to authenticate your calls.

## Delete an API key

1. Log in to n8n.
2. Go to **Settings** > **n8n API**.
3. Select **Delete** next to the key you want to delete.
4. Confirm the delete by selecting **Delete Forever**.

## Call the API using your key

Send the API key in your API call as a header named `X-N8N-API-KEY`. 

For example, say you want to get all active workflows. Your curl request will look like this:

```shell
# For a self-hosted n8n instance
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'

# For n8n Cloud
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'

/// tip | Use the API playground (self-hosted n8n only)
Trying out the API in the [playground](/api/using-api-playground/) can help you understand how APIs work. If you're worried about changing live data, consider setting up a test workflow, or test n8n instance, to explore safely.

# API pagination

The default page size is 100 results. You can change the page size limit. The maximum permitted size is 250.

When a response contains more than one page, it includes a cursor, which you can use to request the next pages.

For example, say you want to get all active workflows, 150 at a time.

Get the first page:

```shell
# For a self-hosted n8n instance
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'

# For n8n Cloud
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'
```

The response is in JSON format, and includes a `nextCursor` value. This is an example response.

```js
{
  ""data"": [
    // The response contains an object for each workflow
    {
      // Workflow data
    }
  ],
  ""nextCursor"": ""MTIzZTQ1NjctZTg5Yi0xMmQzLWE0NTYtNDI2NjE0MTc0MDA""
}
```

Then to request the next page:

```bash
# For a self-hosted n8n instance
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150&cursor=MTIzZTQ1NjctZTg5Yi0xMmQzLWE0NTYtNDI2NjE0MTc0MDA' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'

# For n8n Cloud
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150&cursor=MTIzZTQ1NjctZTg5Yi0xMmQzLWE0NTYtNDI2NjE0MTc0MDA' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```"

# Using the API playground

/// info | Feature availability
The API playground isn't available on Cloud. It's available for all self-hosted pricing tiers.
///

The n8n API comes with a built-in Swagger UI playground in self-hosted versions. This provides interactive documentation, where you can try out requests. The path to access the playground depends on your hosting.

n8n constructs the path from values set in your environment variables:

```shell
N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/docs
```

The API version number is `1`. There may be multiple versions available in the future.

/// warning | Real data
If you select **Authorize** and enter your API key in the API playground, you have access to your live data. This is useful for trying out requests. Be aware you can change or delete real data.
///
The API includes built-in documentation about credential formats. This is available using the `credentials` endpoint:

```shell
N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/credentials/schema/{credentialTypeName}
```

/// note | How to find `credentialTypeName`
To find the type, download your workflow as JSON and examine it. For example, for a Google Drive node the `{credentialTypeName}` is `googleDriveOAuth2Api`:
```json
{
    ...,
    ""credentials"": {
        ""googleDriveOAuth2Api"": {
        ""id"": ""9"",
        ""name"": ""Google Drive""
        }
    }
}
```

# AI coding with GPT

Not available on self-hosted.  

Python isn't supported.
///

## Use AI in the Code node

--8<-- ""_snippets/code/ai-how-to.md""

## Usage limits

During the trial phase there are no usage limits. If n8n makes the feature permanent, there may be usage limits as part of your pricing tier.

## Feature limits

The ChatGPT implementation in n8n has the following limitations:

* The AI writes code that manipulates data from the n8n workflow. You can't ask it to pull in data from other sources.
* The AI doesn't know your data, just the schema, so you need to tell it things like how to find the data you want to extract, or how to check for null.
* Nodes before the Code node must execute and deliver data to the Code node before you run your AI query.
* Doesn't work with large incoming data schemas.
* May have issues if there are a lot of nodes before the code node.

## Writing good prompts

<!-- vale off -->

Writing good prompts increases the chance of getting useful code back.

Some general tips:

* Provide examples: if possible, give a sample expected output. This helps the AI to better understand the transformation or logic you’re aiming for.
* Describe the processing steps: if there are specific processing steps or logic that should apply to the data, list them in sequence. For example: ""First, filter out all users under 18. Then, sort the remaining users by their last name.""
* Avoid ambiguities: while the AI understands various instructions, being clear and direct ensures you get the most accurate code. Instead of saying ""Get the older users,"" you might say ""Filter users who are 60 years and above.""
* Be clear about what you expect as the output. Do you want the data transformed, filtered, aggregated, or sorted? Provide as much detail as possible.

And some n8n-specific guidance:

* Think about the input data: make sure ChatGPT knows which pieces of the data you want to access, and what the incoming data represents. You may need to tell ChatGPT about the availability of n8n's built-in methods and variables.
* Declare interactions between nodes: if your logic involves data from multiple nodes, specify how they should interact. ""Merge the output of 'Node A' with 'Node B' based on the 'userID' property"". if you prefer data to come from certain nodes or to ignore others, be clear: ""Only consider data from the 'Purchases' node and ignore the 'Refunds' node.""
* Ensure the output is compatible with n8n. Refer to [Data structure](/data/data-structure/) for more information on the data structure n8n requires.

### Example prompts

These examples show a range of possible prompts and tasks.

#### Example 1: Find a piece of data inside a second dataset

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/find-a-piece-of-data.json) and import it into n8n.

In the third Code node, enter this prompt:

> The slack data contains only one item. The input data represents all Notion users. Sometimes the person property that holds the email can be null. I want to find the notionId of the Slack user and return it.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

```js
const slackUser = $(""Mock Slack"").all()[0];
const notionUsers = $input.all();
const slackUserEmail = slackUser.json.email;

const notionUser = notionUsers.find(
  (user) => user.json.person && user.json.person.email === slackUserEmail
);

return notionUser ? [{ json: { notionId: notionUser.json.id } }] : [];
```

#### Example 2: Data transformation

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/data-transformation.json) and import it into n8n.

In the **Join items** Code node, enter this prompt:

> Return a single line of text that has all usernames listed with a comma. Each username should be enquoted with a double quotation mark.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

```js
const items = $input.all();
const usernames = items.map((item) => `""${item.json.username}""`);
const result = usernames.join("", "");
return [{ json: { usernames: result } }];
```

#### Example 3: Summarize data and create a Slack message

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/summarize-data.json) and import it into n8n.

In the **Summarize** Code node, enter this prompt:

> Create a markdown text for Slack that counts how many ideas, features and bugs have been submitted. The type of submission is saved in the property_type field. A feature has the property ""Feature"", a bug has the property ""Bug"" and an idea has the property ""Bug"". Also, list the five top submissions by vote in that message. Use ""<url|text>"" as markdown for links.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

```js
const submissions = $input.all();

// Count the number of ideas, features, and bugs
let ideaCount = 0;
let featureCount = 0;
let bugCount = 0;

submissions.forEach((submission) => {
  switch (submission.json.property_type[0]) {
    case ""Idea"":
      ideaCount++;
      break;
    case ""Feature"":
      featureCount++;
      break;
    case ""Bug"":
      bugCount++;
      break;
  }
});

// Sort submissions by votes and take the top 5
const topSubmissions = submissions
  .sort((a, b) => b.json.property_votes - a.json.property_votes)
  .slice(0, 5);

let topSubmissionText = """";
topSubmissions.forEach((submission) => {
  topSubmissionText += `<${submission.json.url}|${submission.json.name}> with ${submission.json.property_votes} votes\n`;
});

// Construct the Slack message
const slackMessage = `*Summary of Submissions*\n
Ideas: ${ideaCount}\n
Features: ${featureCount}\n
Bugs: ${bugCount}\n
Top 5 Submissions:\n
${topSubmissionText}`;

return [{ json: { slackMessage } }];
```

### Reference incoming node data explicitly

If your incoming data contains nested fields, using dot notation to reference them can help the AI understand what data you want.

![""Screenshot of an n8n code node, highlighting how to reference data with dot notation in an AI query""](/_images/code/ai-code/reference-data-dot-notation.png)

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](/_workflows/ai-code/reference-incoming-data-explicitly.json) and import it into n8n.

In the second Code node, enter this prompt:

> The data in ""Mock data"" represents a list of people. For each person, return a new item containing personal_info.first_name and work_info.job_title.

This is the JavaScript you need:

```js
const items = $input.all();
const newItems = items.map((item) => {
  const firstName = item.json.personal_info.first_name;
  const jobTitle = item.json.work_info.job_title;
  return {
    json: {
      firstName,
      jobTitle,
    },
  };
});
return newItems;
```

## Fixing the code

The AI-generated code may work without any changes, but you may have to edit it. You need to be aware of n8n's [Data structure](/data/data-structure/). You may also find n8n's built-in methods and variables useful."

# Expressions

--8<-- ""_snippets/code/tournament-notes.md""

Use expressions to set node parameters dynamically based on data from:

- Previous nodes
- The workflow
- Your n8n environment

You can execute JavaScript within an expression. 

n8n created and uses a templating language called [Tournament](https://github.com/n8n-io/tournament){:target=_blank .external-link}, and extends it with [custom methods and variables](/code-examples/methods-variables-reference/) and [data transformation functions](/code-examples/expressions/data-transformation-functions/) that help with common tasks, such as retrieving data from other nodes, or accessing metadata.

n8n supports two libraries:

- [Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/){:target=_blank .external-link}, for working with data and time.
- [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/){:target=_blank .external-link}, for querying JSON.

/// note | No Python support
Expressions must use JavaScript.
///
/// note | Data in n8n
When writing expressions, it's helpful to understand data structure and behavior in n8n. Refer to [Data](/data/) for more information on working with data in your workflows.
///
## Writing expressions


To use an expression to set a parameter value:

1. Hover over the parameter where you want to use an expression.
2. Select **Expressions** in the **Fixed/Expression** toggle.
3. Write your expression in the parameter, or select **Open expression editor** <span class=""inline-image"">![Open expressions editor icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the expressions editor. If you use the expressions editor, you can browse the available data in the **Variable selector**. All expressions have the format `{{ your expression here }}`.


### Example: Get data from webhook body

Consider the following scenario: you have a webhook trigger that receives data through the webhook body. You want to extract some of that data for use in the workflow.

Your webhook data looks similar to this:


```json
[
  {
    ""headers"": {
      ""host"": ""n8n.instance.address"",
      ...
    },
    ""params"": {},
    ""query"": {},
    ""body"": {
      ""name"": ""Jim"",
      ""age"": 30,
      ""city"": ""New York""
    }
  }
]
```


In the next node in the workflow, you want to get just the value of `city`. You can use the following expression:


```js
{{$json.body.city}}
```

This expression:

1. Accesses the incoming JSON-formatted data using n8n's custom `$json` variable.
2. Finds the value of `city` (in this example, ""New York""). Note that this example uses JMESPath syntax to query the JSON data. You can also write this expression as `{{$json['body']['city']}}`.


### Example: Writing longer JavaScript

An expression contains one line of JavaScript. This means you cannot do things like variable assignments or multiple standalone operations.

To understand the limitations of JavaScript in expressions, and start thinking about workarounds, look at the following two pieces of code. Both code examples use the Luxon date and time library to find the time between two dates in months, and encloses the code in handlebar brackets, like an expression. 

However, the first example isn't a valid n8n expression:


```js
// This example is split over multiple lines for readability
// It's still invalid when formatted as a single line
{{
  function example() {
    let end = DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13');
    let start = DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13');

# Code in n8n

n8n is a low-code tool. This means you can do a lot without code, then add code when needed.

## Code in your workflows

There are two places in your workflows where you can use code:

<div class=""grid-cards-vertical cards"" markdown>

- __Expressions__

	Use expressions to transform [data](/data/) in your nodes. You can use JavaScript in expressions, as well as n8n's [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) and [Data transformation functions](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/).

	[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Expressions](/code/expressions/)

- __Code node__

	Use the Code node to add JavaScript or Python to your workflow.

	[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Code node](/code/code-node/)

</div>


## Other technical resources

These are features that are relevant to technical users.

### Technical nodes

n8n provides core nodes, which simplify adding key functionality such as API requests, webhooks, scheduling, and file handling.

<div class=""grid-cards-vertical cards"" markdown>

- __Write a backend__

	The [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/), [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/), and [Code](/code/code-node/) nodes help you make API calls, respond to webhooks, and write any JavaScript in your workflow.

	Use this do things like [Create an API endpoint](https://n8n.io/workflows/1750-creating-an-api-endpoint/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

	[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Core nodes](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/)

- __Represent complex logic__

	You can build complex flows, using nodes like [If](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/), [Switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/), and [Merge](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) nodes. 

	[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Flow logic](/flow-logic/)

</div>

### Other developer resources

<div class=""grid-cards-vertical cards"" markdown>

- __The n8n API__

	n8n provides an API, where you can programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the GUI. There's an [n8n API node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to access the API in your workflows.

	[:octicons-arrow-right-24: API](/api/)

- __Self-host__

	You can self-host n8n. This keeps your data on your own infrastructure.

	[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Hosting](/hosting/)

- __Build your own nodes__

	You can build custom nodes, install them on your n8n instance, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

	[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Creating nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview/)

# Custom variables

/// info | Feature availability
* Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Pro Cloud plans.
* You need access to the n8n instance owner account to create and edit variables. All users can use existing variables.

Available in version 0.225.0 and above.
///	

Custom variables are read-only variables that you can use to store and reuse values in n8n workflows. 

/// warning | Variables are shared
When you create a variable, it's available to everyone on your n8n instance.
///

## Create variables

To create a new variable:

1. On the **Variables** page, select **Add Variable**.
2. Enter a **Key** and **Value**. The maximum key length is 50 characters, and the maximum value length is 220 characters. n8n limits the characters you can use in the key and value to lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`).
3. Select **Save**. The variable is now available for use in all workflows in the n8n instance.

## Edit and delete variables

To edit or delete a variable:

1. On the **Variables** page, hover over the variable you want to change.
2. Select **Edit** or **Delete**.

## Use variables in workflows

You can access variables in the Code node and in expressions:

```javascript
// Access a variable
$vars.<variable-name>
```

All variables are strings.

During workflow execution, n8n replaces the variables with the variable value. If the variable has no value, n8n treats its value as `undefined`. Workflows don't automatically fail in this case.

Variables are read-only. You must use the UI to change the values. If you need to set and access custom data within your workflow, use [Workflow static data](/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/)."

# Data transformation functions

Data transformation functions are helper functions to make data transformation easier in expressions.

/// note | JavaScript in expressions
You can use any JavaScript in expressions. Refer to [Expressions](/code/expressions/) for more information.
///
For a list of available functions, refer to the page for your data type:

* [Arrays](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/arrays/)
* [Dates](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/)
* [Numbers](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/numbers/)
* [Objects](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/objects/)
* [Strings](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/strings/)

## Usage

Data transformation functions are available in the expressions editor.

The syntax is:

```js
{{ dataItem.function() }}
```

For example, to check if a string is an email:

```js
{{ ""example@example.com"".isEmail() }}

// Returns true
```"

# Query JSON with JMESPath

[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a query language for JSON that you can use to extract and transform elements from a JSON document. For full details of how to use JMESPath, refer to the [JMESPath documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html){:target=_blank .external-link}.


## The `jmespath()` method

n8n provides a custom method, `jmespath()`. Use this method to perform a search on a JSON object using the JMESPath query language.

The basic syntax is: 

=== ""JavaScript""
	```js
	$jmespath(object, searchString)
	```
=== ""Python""
	```python
	_jmespath(object, searchString)
	```


To help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent longer JavaScript:


```js
var jmespath = require('jmespath');
jmespath.search(object, searchString);
```

/// note | Expressions must be single-line
The longer code example doesn't work in Expressions, as they must be single-line.
///

`object` is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. `searchString` is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification){:target=_blank .external-link} provides a list of supported expressions, while their [Tutorial](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html) and [Examples](https://jmespath.org/examples.html){:target=_blank .external-link} provide interactive examples.

/// warning | Search parameter order
The examples in the [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification){:target=_blank .external-link} follow the pattern `search(searchString, object)`. The [JMESPath JavaScript library](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.js/){:target=_blank .external-link}, which n8n uses, supports `search(object, searchString)` instead. This means that when using examples from the JMESPath documentation, you may need to change the order of the search function parameters.
///

## Common tasks

This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [JMESPath's own documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html){:target=_blank .external-link}.

When trying out these examples, you need to set the Code node **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item**.

### Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections

From the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections){:target=_blank .external-link}:

> Projections are one of the key features of JMESPath. Use it to apply an expression to a collection of elements. JMESPath supports five kinds of projections:
> 
> * List Projections
> * Slice Projections
> * Object Projections
> * Flatten Projections
> * Filter Projections

The following example shows basic usage of list, slice, and object projections. Refer to the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections){:target=_blank .external-link} for detailed explanations of each projection type, and more examples.

Given this JSON from a webhook node:


```js

    }
  }
]

```


Retrieve a [list](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#list-and-slice-projections){:target=_blank .external-link} of all the people's first names:

=== ""Expressions (JavaScript)""

	```js
	{{$jmespath($json.body.people, ""[*].first"" )}}
	// Returns [""James"", ""Jacob"", ""Jayden""]
	```

=== ""Code node (JavaScript)""

	```js
	let firstNames = $jmespath($json.body.people, ""[*].first"" )
	return {firstNames};
	/* Returns:

			]
		}
	]
	""""""
	```

Get a [slice](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#list-and-slice-projections){:target=_blank .external-link} of the first names:

			]
		}
	]
	*/
	```
=== ""Code node (Python)""
	```python
	dogsAges = _jmespath(_json.body.dogs, ""*.age"")

	""""""
	Returns:
	[
		{
			""dogsAges"": [
				7,
				5
			]
		}
	]
	""""""
	```

### Select multiple elements and create a new list or object

Use [Multiselect](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#multiselect){:target=_blank .external-link} to select elements from a JSON object and combine them into a new list or object.

Given this JSON from a webhook node:


```js
[
  {
    ""headers"": {
      ""host"": ""n8n.instance.address"",
      ...
    },
    ""params"": {},
    ""query"": {},
    ""body"": {
      ""people"": [
        {
          ""first"": ""James"",
          ""last"": ""Green""
        },
        {
          ""first"": ""Jacob"",
          ""last"": ""Jones""
        },
        {
          ""first"": ""Jayden"",
          ""last"": ""Smith""
        }
      ],
      ""dogs"": {
        ""Fido"": {
          ""color"": ""brown"",
          ""age"": 7
        },
        ""Spot"": {
          ""color"": ""black and white"",
          ""age"": 5
        }
      }
    }
  }
]

```

<!-- vale off -->
Use multiselect list to get the first and last names and create new lists containing both names:
<!-- vale on -->
=== ""Expressions (JavaScript)""

	[[% raw %]]
	```js
	{{$jmespath($json.body.people, ""[].[first, last]"")}}
	// Returns [[""James"",""Green""],[""Jacob"",""Jones""],[""Jayden"",""Smith""]]
	```
	[[% endraw %]]

=== ""Code node (JavaScript)""

	```js
	let newList = $jmespath($json.body.people, ""[].[first, last]"");
	return {newList};
	/* Returns:
	[
		{
			""newList"": [
				[
					""James"",
					""Green""
				],
				[
					""Jacob"",
					""Jones""
				],
				[
					""Jayden"",
					""Smith""
				]
			]
		}
	]
	*/
	```
=== ""Code node (Python)""
	```python
	newList = _jmespath(_json.body.people, ""[].[first, last]"")
	return {""newList"":newList}
	""""""
	Returns:
	[
		{
			""newList"": [
				[
					""James"",
					""Green""
				],
				[
					""Jacob"",
					""Jones""
				],
				[
					""Jayden"",
					""Smith""
				]
			]
		}
	]
	""""""
	```

### An alternative to arrow functions in expressions

For example, generate some input data by returning the below code from the Code node:

```js
return[
  {
    ""json"": {      
      ""num_categories"": ""0"",
      ""num_products"": ""45"",
      ""category_id"": 5529735,
      ""parent_id"": 1407340,
      ""pos_enabled"": 1,
      ""pos_favorite"": 0,
      ""name"": ""HP"",
      ""description"": """",
      ""image"": """"
    }
  },
  {
    ""json"": {
      ""num_categories"": ""0"",
      ""num_products"": ""86"",
      ""category_id"": 5529740,
      ""parent_id"": 1407340,
      ""pos_enabled"": 1,
      ""pos_favorite"": 0,
      ""name"": ""Lenovo"",
      ""description"": """",
      ""image"": """"
    }
  }  
]
```

You could do a search like ""find the item with the name Lenovo and tell me their category ID.""

```js
{{ $jmespath($(""Code"").all(), ""[?json.name=='Lenovo'].json.category_id"") }}
```"

# Date and time with Luxon

[Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with date and time. For full details of how to use Luxon, refer to [Luxon's documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon){:target=_blank .external-link}. 

n8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon makes this easier.

/// note | Python support
Luxon is a JavaScript library. The two convenience [variables](#variables) created by n8n are available when using Python in the Code node, but their functionality is limited:

* You can't perform Luxon operations on these variables. For example, there is no Python equivalent for `$today.minus(...)`.
* The generic Luxon functionality, such as [Convert date string to Luxon](#convert-date-string-to-Luxon), isn't available for Python users.
///	


## Variables

n8n uses Luxon to provide two custom variables:

- `now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to `DateTime.now()`.
- `today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 })`.

Note that these variables can return different time formats when cast as a string. This is the same behavior as Luxon's `DateTime.now()`.

=== ""Expressions (JavaScript)""

	``` js
	{{$now}}
	// n8n displays the ISO formatted timestamp
	// For example 2022-03-09T14:02:37.065+00:00
	{{""Today's date is "" + $now}}
	// n8n displays ""Today's date is <unix timestamp>""
	// For example ""Today's date is 1646834498755""
	```

=== ""Code node (JavaScript)""

	``` js
	$now
	// n8n displays <ISO formatted timestamp>
	// For example 2022-03-09T14:00:25.058+00:00
	let rightNow = ""Today's date is "" + $now
	// n8n displays ""Today's date is <unix timestamp>""
	// For example ""Today's date is 1646834498755""
	```
=== ""Code node (Python)""
	``` python
	_now
	# n8n displays <ISO formatted timestamp>
	# For example 2022-03-09T14:00:25.058+00:00
	rightNow = ""Today's date is "" + str(_now)
	# n8n displays ""Today's date is <unix timestamp>""
	# For example ""Today's date is 1646834498755""
	```

n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.

## Date and time behavior in n8n

Be aware of the following:

* In a workflow, n8n converts dates and times to strings between nodes. Keep this in mind when doing arithmetic on dates and times from other nodes.
* With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat(""23-06-2019"", ""dd-MM-yyyy"")`.

## Setting the timezone in n8n

Luxon uses the n8n timezone. This value is either:

* Default: `America/New York`
* A custom timezone for your n8n instance, set using the `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable.
* A custom timezone for an individual workflow, configured in workflow settings.

## Common tasks

This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [Luxon's own documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}.


### Convert date string to Luxon

You can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings.

/// note | A difference between Luxon DateTime and JavaScript Date
With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat(""23-06-2019"", ""dd-MM-yyyy"")`.
///
#### If you have a date in a supported standard technical format: 

Most dates use `fromISO()`. This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example:

=== ""Expressions (JavaScript)""

	```js
	{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')}}
	```

=== ""Code node (JavaScript)""

	```js
	let luxonDateTime = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')
	```


Luxon's API documentation has more information on [fromISO](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimefromiso){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}.

Luxon provides functions to handle conversions for a range of formats. Refer to Luxon's guide to [Parsing technical formats](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=parsing-technical-formats) for details.

#### If you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format: 

Use Luxon's [Ad-hoc parsing](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=ad-hoc-parsing){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}. To do this, use the `fromFormat()` function, providing the string and a set of [tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=table-of-tokens){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} that describe the format.

For example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as `23-06-2019`. You want to turn this into a Luxon object:

=== ""Expressions (JavaScript)""

	```js
	{{DateTime.fromFormat(""23-06-2019"", ""dd-MM-yyyy"")}}
	```

=== ""Code node (JavaScript)""

	```js
	let newFormat = DateTime.fromFormat(""23-06-2019"", ""dd-MM-yyyy"")
	```

When using ad-hoc parsing, note Luxon's warning about [Limitations](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=limitations){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}. If you see unexpected results, try their [Debugging](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=debugging){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} guide.

### Get n days from today

Get a number of days before or after today. 

=== ""Expressions (JavaScript)""

	For example, you want to set a field to always show the date seven days before the current date.

	In the expressions editor, enter:


	``` js
	{{$today.minus({days: 7})}}
	```

	On the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: ""2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00""]`.

	This example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.

=== ""Code node (JavaScript)""

	For example, you want a variable containing the date seven days before the current date.

	In the code editor, enter:

	``` js
	let sevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7})
	```

	On the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: ""2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00""]`.

	This example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.

For more detailed information and examples, refer to:

* Luxon's [guide to math](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math)
* Their API documentation on [DateTime plus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeplus) and [DateTime minus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeminus)

### Create human-readable dates

In [Get n days from today](#get-n-days-from-today), the example gets the date seven days before the current date, and returns it as `[Object: ""yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00""]` (for expressions) or `yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00` (in the Code node). To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions.

For example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY, so that on the 23rd June 2019, it returns `23/06/2019`.

This expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format.

=== ""Expressions (JavaScript)""

	```js
	{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()}}
	```

=== ""Code node (JavaScript)""

	```js
	let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()
	```

You can alter the format. For example:

=== ""Expressions (JavaScript)""

	```js
	{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})}}
	```

	On 23rd June 2019, this returns ""16 June 2019"".

=== ""Code node (JavaScript)""

	```js
	let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})
	```

	On 23rd June 2019, this returns ""16 June 2019"".

Refer to Luxon's guide on [toLocaleString (strings for humans)](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting?id=tolocalestring-strings-for-humans){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} for more information.


### Get the time between two dates

To get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration.

For example, get the number of months between two dates:

=== ""Expressions (JavaScript)""

	```js
	{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()}}
	```

	This returns `[Object: {""months"":1}]`.

=== ""Code node (JavaScript)""

	```js
	let monthsBetweenDates = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()
	```

	This returns `{""months"":1}`.

Refer to Luxon's [Diffs](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math?id=diffs){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

### A longer example: How many days to Christmas?

This example brings together several Luxon features, uses JMESPath, and does some basic string manipulation. 

The scenario: you want a countdown to 25th December. Every day, it should tell you the number of days remaining to Christmas. You don't want to update it for next year - it needs to seamlessly work for every year.

=== ""Expressions (JavaScript)""

	```js
	{{""There are "" + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + "" days to Christmas!""}}
	```

	This outputs `""There are <number of days> days to Christmas!""`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs ""There are 291 days to Christmas!"".

	A detailed explanation of what the expression does:

	* `{{`: indicates the start of the expression.
	* `""There are ""`: a string. 
	* `+`: used to join two strings.
	* `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in [Get the time between two dates](#get-the-time-between-two-dates), but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.
	* `DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days'`: this part gets the current year using `$today.year`, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.
	* `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {""days"":-<number-of-days>}]`. For example, on 9th March, `[Object: {""days"":-291}]`.
	* `.days` uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our [JMESpath](/code/cookbook/jmespath/) documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.
	* `.toString().substring(1)` turns the number into a string and removes the `-`.
	* `+ "" days to Christmas!""`: another string, with a `+` to join it to the previous string.
	* `}}`: indicates the end of the expression.

=== ""Code node (JavaScript)""

	```js
	let daysToChristmas = ""There are "" + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + "" days to Christmas!"";
	```

	This outputs `""There are <number of days> days to Christmas!""`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs ""There are 291 days to Christmas!"".

	A detailed explanation of what the code does:

	* `""There are ""`: a string.

# `(""<node-name>"").all(branchIndex?: number, runIndex?: number)`

This gives access to all the items of the current or parent nodes. If you don't supply any parameters, it returns all the items of the current node.

## Getting items

=== ""JavaScript""
	```js
	// Returns all the items of the given node and current run
	let allItems = $(""<node-name>"").all();

	// Returns all items the node ""IF"" outputs (index: 0 which is Output ""true"" of its most recent run)
	let allItems = $(""IF"").all();

	// Returns all items the node ""IF"" outputs (index: 0 which is Output ""true"" of the same run as current node)
	let allItems = $(""IF"").all(0, $runIndex);

	// Returns all items the node ""IF"" outputs (index: 1 which is Output ""false"" of run 0 which is the first run)
	let allItems = $(""IF"").all(1, 0);
	```
=== ""Python""
	```python
	# Returns all the items of the given node and current run
	allItems = _(""<node-name>"").all();

	# Returns all items the node ""IF"" outputs (index: 0 which is Output ""true"" of its most recent run)
	allItems = _(""IF"").all();

	# Returns all items the node ""IF"" outputs (index: 0 which is Output ""true"" of the same run as current node)
	allItems = _(""IF"").all(0, _runIndex);

	# Returns all items the node ""IF"" outputs (index: 1 which is Output ""false"" of run 0 which is the first run)
	allItems = _(""IF"").all(1, 0);
	```

## Accessing item data

Get all items output by a previous node, and log out the data they contain:

=== ""JavaScript""
	```typescript
	previousNodeData = $(""<node-name>"").all();
	for(let i=0; i<previousNodeData.length; i++) {
		console.log(previousNodeData[i].json);
	}
	```
=== ""Python""
	```python
	previousNodeData = _(""<node-name>"").all();
	for item in previousNodeData:
		# item is of type <class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>
		# You need to convert it to a Dict
  		itemDict = item.json.to_py()
  		print(itemDict)

# `getWorkflowStaticData(type)`

This gives access to the static workflow data.

/// note | Experimental feature
- Static data isn't available when testing workflows. The workflow must be active and called by a trigger or webhook to save static data.
- This feature may behave unreliably under high-frequency workflow executions.
///
You can save data directly in the workflow. This data should be small.

As an example: you can save a timestamp of the last item processed from
an RSS feed or database. It will always return an object. Properties can then read, delete or
set on that object. When the workflow execution succeeds, n8n checks automatically if the data
has changed and saves it, if necessary.

There are two types of static data, global and node. Global static data is the
same in the whole workflow. Every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data is unique to the node. Only the node that set it can retrieve it again.

Example with global data:

=== ""JavaScript""
	```javascript
	// Get the global workflow static data
	const workflowStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('global');

	// Access its data
	const lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution;

	// Update its data
	workflowStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime();

	// Delete data
	delete workflowStaticData.lastExecution;
	```
=== ""Python""
	```python
	# Get the global workflow static data
	workflowStaticData = _getWorkflowStaticData('global')

	# Access its data
	lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution

	# Update its data
	workflowStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime()

	# Delete data
	delete workflowStaticData.lastExecution
	```

Example with node data:

=== ""JavaScript""
	```js
	// Get the static data of the node
	const nodeStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('node');

	// Access its data
	const lastExecution = nodeStaticData.lastExecution;

	// Update its data
	nodeStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime();

	// Delete data
	delete nodeStaticData.lastExecution;
	```
=== ""Python""
	```python
	# Get the static data of the node
	nodeStaticData = _getWorkflowStaticData('node')

	# Access its data
	lastExecution = nodeStaticData.lastExecution

	# Update its data
	nodeStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime()

	# Delete data
	delete nodeStaticData.lastExecution
	```

contentType: howto

# Retrieve linked items from earlier in the workflow

Every item in a node's input data links back to the items used in previous nodes to generate it. This is useful if you need to retrieve linked items from further back than the immediate previous node.

To access the linked items from earlier in the workflow, use `(""<node-name>"").itemMatching(currentNodeinputIndex)`.


For example, consider a workflow that does the following:

1. The Customer Datastore node generates example data:
	```json
	[
		{
			""id"": ""23423532"",
			""name"": ""Jay Gatsby"",
			""email"": ""gatsby@west-egg.com"",
			""notes"": ""Keeps asking about a green light??"",
			""country"": ""US"",
			""created"": ""1925-04-10""
		},
		{
			""id"": ""23423533"",
			""name"": ""José Arcadio Buendía"",
			""email"": ""jab@macondo.co"",
			""notes"": ""Lots of people named after him. Very confusing"",
			""country"": ""CO"",
			""created"": ""1967-05-05""
		},
		...
    ]
	```
2. The Edit Fields node simplifies this data:
	```json
	[
		{
			""name"": ""Jay Gatsby""
		},
		{
			""name"": ""José Arcadio Buendía""
		},
        ...
	]
	```
3. The Code node restore the email address to the correct person:
	```json
	[
		{
			""name"": ""Jay Gatsby"",
			""restoreEmail"": ""gatsby@west-egg.com""
		},
		{
			""name"": ""José Arcadio Buendía"",
			""restoreEmail"": ""jab@macondo.co""
		},
		...
	]
	```

The Code node does this using the following code:

=== ""JavaScript""
	```js
	for(let i=0; i<$input.all().length; i++) {
  		$input.all()[i].json.restoreEmail = $('Customer Datastore (n8n training)').itemMatching(i).json.email;
	}
	return $input.all();
	```
=== ""Python""
	```python
	for i,item in enumerate(_input.all()):
  		_input.all()[i].json.restoreEmail = _('Customer Datastore (n8n training)').itemMatching(i).json.email

	return _input.all();
	```

# Output to the browser console with `console.log()` or `print()` in the Code node

You can use `console.log()` or `print()` in the Code node to help when writing and debugging your code.

For help opening your browser console, refer to [this guide by Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## console.log (JavaScript)

For technical information on `console.log()`, refer to the [MDN developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log){:target=_blank .external-link}.

For example, copy the following code into a Code node, then open your console and run the node:

```js
let a = ""apple"";
console.log(a);
```

## print (Python)

For technical information on `print()`, refer to the [Real Python's guide](https://realpython.com/python-print/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

For example, set your Code node **Language** to **Python**, copy the following code into the node, then open your console and run the node:

```python
a = ""apple""
print(a)
```

### Handling an output of `[object Object]`

If the console displays `[object Object]` when you print, check the data type, then convert it as needed.

To check the data type:

```python
print(type(myData))
```

#### JsProxy

If `type()` outputs `<class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>`, you need to convert the JsProxy to a native Python object using `to_py()`. This occurs when working with data in the n8n node data structure, such as node inputs and outputs. For example, if you want to print the data from a previous node in the workflow:

```python
previousNodeData = _(""<node-name>"").all();
for item in previousNodeData:
	# item is of type <class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>
	# You need to convert it to a Dict
	itemDict = item.json.to_py()
	print(itemDict)
```

Refer to the Pyodide documentation on [JsProxy](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/python-api/ffi.html#pyodide.ffi.JsProxy){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on this class."

# Get the binary data buffer

The binary data buffer contains all the binary file data processed by a workflow. You need to access it if you want to perform operations on the binary data, such as:

* Manipulating the data: for example, adding column headers to a CSV file.
* Using the data in calculations: for example, calculating a hash value based on it.
* Complex HTTP requests: for example, combining file upload with sending other data formats.

/// note | Not available in Python
`getBinaryDataBuffer()` isn't supported when using Python.
///
You can access the buffer using n8n's `getBinaryDataBuffer()` function:


```js
/* 
* itemIndex: number. The index of the item in the input data.
* binaryPropertyName: string. The name of the binary property. 
* The default in the Read/Write File From Disk node is 'data'. 
*/
let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(itemIndex, binaryPropertyName);
```

For example:

```js
let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(0, 'data');
// Returns the data in the binary buffer for the first input item
```


You should always use the `getBinaryDataBuffer()` function, and avoid using older methods of directly accessing the buffer, such as targeting it with expressions like `items[0].binary.data.data`."

# Check incoming data

At times, you may want to check the incoming data. If the incoming data doesn't match a condition, you may want to return a different value. For example, you want to check if a variable from the previous node is empty and return a string if it's empty. Use the following code snippet to return `not found` if the variable is empty.

```javascript
{{$json[""variable_name""]? $json[""variable_name""] :""not found""}}
```

The above expression uses the ternary operator. You can learn more about the ternary operator [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator).

As an alternative, you can use the [nullish coalescing operator (??)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing) or the [logical or operator (||)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR):

```javascript
{{ $x ?? ""default value"" }}
{{ $x || ""default value"" }}
```

In either of the above two cases, the value of `$x` will be used if it's set to a non-null, non-false value. The string `default value` is the fallback value."

# Expressions common issues

Here are some common errors and issues related to [expressions](/code/expressions/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## The 'JSON Output' in item 0 contains invalid JSON

This error occurs when you use JSON mode but don't provide a valid JSON object. Depending on the problem with the JSON object, the error sometimes display as `The 'JSON Output' in item 0 does not contain a valid JSON object`.

To resolve this, make sure that the code you provide is valid JSON:

- Check the JSON with a [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/).
- Check that your JSON object doesn't reference undefined input data. This may occur if the incoming data doesn't always include the same fields.

## Can't get data for expression

This error occurs when n8n can't retrieve the data referenced by an expression. Often, this happens when the preceding node hasn't been run yet.

Another variation of this may appear as `Referenced node is unexecuted`.  In that case, the full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:

> An expression references the node '&lt;node-name&gt;', but it hasn’t been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first.
> 

To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.

For nodes that use JavaScript or other custom code, you can check if a previous node has executed before trying to use its value by checking the following:

```javascript
$(""<node-name>"").isExecuted
```

As an example, this JSON references the parameters of the input data. This error will display if you test this step without connecting it to another node:

```javascript
{
  ""my_field_1"": {{ $input.params }}
}
```

## Invalid syntax

This error occurs when you use an expression that has a syntax error.

For example, the expression in this JSON includes a trailing period, which results in an invalid syntax error:

```jsx
{
  ""my_field_1"": ""value"",
  ""my_field_2"": {{ $('If').item.json. }}
}

```

To resolve this error, check your [expression syntax](https://www.notion.so/code/expressions/) to make sure they follow the expected format."

# Pagination in the HTTP Request node

The HTTP Request node supports pagination. This page provides some example configurations, including using the [HTTP node variables](/code/builtin/http-node-variables/).

Refer to [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) for more information on the node.

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/http/pagination-api-differences.md""


## Enable pagination

In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Pagination**.

## Use a URL from the response to get the next page using `$response`

If the API returns the URL of the next page in its response:

1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Response Contains Next URL**. n8n displays the parameters for this option.
1. In **Next URL**, use an expression to set the URL. The exact expression depends on the data returned by your API. For example, if the API includes a parameter called `next-page` in the response body:
	```javascript
	{{ $response.body[""next-page""] }}
	```

## Get the next page by number using `$pageCount`

If the API you're using supports targeting a specific page by number:

1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
1. Set **Type** to **Query**.
1. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API and is usually described in its documentation. For example, some APIs use a query parameter named `page` to set the page. So **Name** would be `page`.
1. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
1. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`

`$pageCount` is the number of pages the HTTP Request node has fetched. It starts at zero. Most API pagination counts from one (the first page is page one). This means that adding `+1` to `$pageCount` means the node fetches page one on its first loop, page two on its second, and so on.

## Navigate pagination through body parameters

If the API you're using allows you to paginate through the body parameters:

1. Set the HTTP Request Method to **POST**
1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
1. Select **Body** in the **Type** parameter.
1. Enter the **Name** of the body parameter. This depends on the API you're using. `page` is a common key name.
1. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
1. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`

## Set the page size in the query

If the API you're using supports choosing the page size in the query:

1. Select **Send Query Parameters** in main node parameters (this is the parameters you see when you first open the node, not the settings within options).
1. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API. For example, a lot of APIs use a query parameter named `limit` to set page size. So **Name** would be `limit`.
1. In **Value**, enter your page size."

# Text courses

If you've found your way here, it means you're serious about your interest in automation. Maybe you're tired of manually entering data into the same spreadsheet every day, of clicking through a series of tabs and buttons for that one piece of information you need, of managing tens of different tools and systems.

Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: you shouldn't spend precious time doing things that don't spark joy or contribute to your personal and professional growth.

These tasks can and should be automated! And you don't need advanced technical knowledge or excellent coding skills to do this–with no-code tools like n8n, automation is for everyone.

# Navigating the Editor UI

In this lesson you will learn how to navigate the Editor UI. We will walk through the canvas and show you what each icon means and where to find things you will need while building workflows in n8n.

## Getting started

Begin by setting up n8n. There are two ways you can do this:

- [n8n Cloud](https://app.n8n.cloud/register){:target=""_blank"" .external} - Hosted solution, no installation needed. Great for all levels of experience.
- [Self-host](/hosting/){:target=""_blank"" .external} - Recommended for advanced users with technical knowledge

For more details on the different ways to set up n8n, see our [platforms documentation](/choose-n8n/#platforms){:target=""_blank"" .external}.

/// warning | n8n version
This course was developed on n8n version 1.30.0. In other versions, some of the user interface might look different, but the core functionality shouldn't be impacted.
///
Once you have n8n running, open the Editor UI in a browser window. It should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-editor-ui.png"" alt=""Editor UI"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Editor UI</i></figcaption></figure>

## Editor UI settings

The [Editor UI](/editor-ui/) is the web interface where you build [workflows](/workflows/workflows/). You can access all your workflows and credentials, as well as support pages, from the Editor UI.

### Left-side panel

On the left side of the **Editor UI**, there is a panel which contains the core functionalities and settings for managing your workflows. Expand and collapse it by selecting the small arrow icon.

The panel contains the following sections:

- **Overview**: Contains all the workflows and credentials you have access to. During this course, create new workflows here.
- **Templates**: A collection of pre-made workflows. Great place to get started with common use cases.
- **Variables**: Used to store and access fixed data across your workflows. This feature is available on the Pro and Enterprise Plans.
- **All executions**: Contains information about your workflow executions.
- **Settings**: Manage users and access settings for a variety of features.
- **Help**: Contains resources around n8n product and community.
- **Admin Panel**: n8n Cloud only. Access your n8n instance usage, billing, and version settings.
- **Update**: n8n Cloud only. Indicator for any recently released product updates.

<figure style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-side-panel.png"" alt=""Editor UI left-side menu"" style=""height: 600px;""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Editor UI left-side menu</i></figcaption></figure>

### Top bar

The top bar of the **Editor UI** contains the following information:

- **Workflow Name**: By default, n8n names a new workflow as “My Workflow,” but you can edit the name at any time.
- **+Add Tag**: Tags help you organise your workflows by category, use case, or whatever is relevant for you. Tags are optional.
- **Inactive/active toggle**: This button activates or deactivates the current workflow. By default, workflows are deactivated.
- **Share**: You can share and collaborate with others on workflows on the Starter, Pro, and Enterprise plans.
- **Save**: This button saves the current workflow.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-top-bar.png"" alt=""Editor UI top bar"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Editor UI top bar</i></figcaption></figure>

### Canvas

The **canvas** is the gray dotted grid background in the Editor UI. It displays several icons and a node with different functionalities:

- Buttons to zoom the canvas to fit the screen, zoom in or out of the canvas, and reset the canvas to the original resolution.
- A button to **Execute Workflow**. When you click on it, all nodes on the canvas are executed.
- A button with a **+** sign inside. This button opens the nodes panel.
- A button with a note icon inside. This button adds a [sticky note](/workflows/sticky-notes){:target=""_blank"" .external} to the canvas. (Visible when hovering on the top right + icon)
- A dotted square with the text ""Add first step."" This is where you add your first node.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-canvas.png"" alt=""Workflow canvas"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow canvas</i></figcaption></figure>

/// note | Moving the canvas
You can move the workflow canvas around in three ways:

- Select **Ctrl + Left Mouse Button** on the canvas and move it around.
- Select **Middle Mouse Button** on the canvas and move it around.
- Place two fingers on your touchpad and slide.
///


Don't worry about workflow execution and activation for now; we'll explain these concepts later on in the course.

## Nodes

You can think of nodes as building blocks that serve different functions that, when put together, make up a functioning machine: an automated workflow.

/// note | Node
A node is an individual step in your workflow: one that either (a) loads, (b) processes, or (c) sends data.
///

Based on their function, n8n classifies nodes into four types:

- **App** or **Action Nodes** add, remove, and edit data; request and send external data; and trigger events in other systems. Refer to the [Action nodes library](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) for a full list of these nodes.
- **Trigger Nodes** start a workflow and supply the initial data. Refer to the [Trigger nodes library](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/) for a full list of trigger nodes.
- **Core Nodes** can be core or app nodes. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls. Refer to the [Core Nodes library](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/) for a full list of core nodes.
- **Cluster Nodes** are node groups that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. Refer to [Cluster nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/) for more information.

/// note | Learn more
Refer to [Node types](/builtin/node-types/) for a more detailed explanation of all node types.
///

### Finding nodes

You can find all available nodes in the **nodes panel** on the right side of the Editor UI. There are three ways in which you can open the nodes panel:

- Click the **+** icon in the top right corner of the canvas.
- Click the **+** icon on the right side of an existing node on the canvas (the node to which you want to add another one).
- Click the Tab key on your keyboard.

<figure style=""text-align: center; width:50%; margin:auto;""><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-node-menu-drilldown.gif"" alt=""Nodes panel""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Nodes panel</i></figcaption></figure>

In the nodes panel, notice that when adding your first node, you will see the different trigger node categories. After you have added your trigger node, you'll see that the nodes panel changes to show Action, Data transformation, Helper, Flow and File nodes.

If you want to find a specific node, use the search input at the top of the nodes panel.


### Adding nodes

There are two ways to add nodes to your canvas:

- Select the node you want in the nodes panel. The new node will automatically connect to the selected node on the canvas.
- Drag and drop the node from the nodes panel to the canvas.

### Node buttons

If you hover on a node, you'll notice that three icons appear on top:

- Execute the node (Play icon)
- Deactivate/Activate the node (Power icon)
- Delete the node (Trash icon)

Additionally, you'll see an elipsis icon, which opens a context menu containing other [node options](/workflows/components/nodes/#node-controls).

/// note | Moving a workflow
To move a workflow around the canvas, select all nodes with your mouse or by selecting **Ctrl + A**, select and hold on a node, then drag it to any point you want on the canvas.
///

## Summary

In this lesson you learned how to navigate the Editor UI, what the icons mean, how to access the left-side and node panels, and how to add nodes to the canvas and interpret their execution results.

In the next lesson, you will build a mini-workflow to put into practice what you've learned so far."

# Building a Mini-workflow

In this lesson, you will build a small workflow that gets 10 articles about automation from Hacker News. The workflow consists of five steps:

1. [Add a Manual Trigger node](#1-add-a-manual-trigger-node)
2. [Add the Hacker News node](#2-add-the-hacker-news-node)
3. [Configure the Hacker News node](#3-configure-the-hacker-news-node)
4. [Execute the node](#4-execute-the-node)
5. [Save the workflow](#5-save-the-workflow)

## 1. Add a Manual Trigger node

Open the nodes panel (reminder: you can open this by selecting the **+** icon in the top right corner of the canvas or selecting Tab on your keyboard).

Then:

1. Search for the **Manual Trigger** node.
2. Select it when it appears in the search.

This will add the Manual Trigger node to your canvas, which will allow you to run the workflow any time by selecting the **Test workflow** button.

/// note | Manual triggers
For faster workflow creation, you can skip this step in the future. Adding any other node without a trigger will add the Manual Trigger node to the workflow.

In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to set up a schedule or some other trigger to run the workflow.
///

## 2. Add the Hacker News node

Select the **+** icon to the right of the Manual Trigger node to open the nodes panel.

Then:

1. Search for the **Hacker News** node.
2. Select it when it appears in the search.
3. In the **Actions** section, select **Get many items**.

n8n adds the node to your canvas and the node window opens to display its configuration details.

## 3. Configure the Hacker News node

When you add a new node to the Editor UI, the node is automatically activated. The node details will open in a window with several options:

- **Parameters**: Adjust parameters to refine and control the node's functionality.
- **Settings**: Adjust settings to control the node's design and executions.
- **Docs**: Open the n8n documentation for this node in a new window.


/// note | Parameters vs. Settings
**Parameters** are different for each node, depending on its functionality.<br />
**Settings** are the same for all nodes.
///


### Parameters

We need to configure several parameters for the Hacker News node to make it work:

- **Resource**: All <br/>
This resource selects all data records (articles).
- **Operation**: Get Many <br/>
This operation fetches all the selected articles.
- **Limit**: 10 <br/>
This parameter sets a limit to how many results the Get Many operation returns.
- **Additional Fields** > **Add Field** > **Keyword**: automation <br/>
**Additional fields** are options that you can add to certain nodes to make your request more specific or filter the results. For this example, we want to get only articles that include the keyword ""automation."" <br/>

The configuration of the parameters for the Hacker News node should now look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c-2-hacker-news-node-parameters.png"" alt=""Hacker News node parameters"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Hacker News node parameters</i></figcaption></figure>

### Settings

The **Settings** section includes several options for node design and executions. In this case, we'll configure only the final two settings, which set the node's appearance in the Editor UI canvas.

In the Hacker News node Settings, edit:

- **Notes**: Get the 10 latest articles.

    /// note | Node notes
    It's often helpful to add a short description in the node about what it does. This is especially helpful for complex or shared workflows!
    ///

- **Display note in flow?**: toggle to true<br/>
This option will display the Note under the node in the canvas.

The configuration of the settings for the Hacker News node should now look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-hacker-news-node-setting-configuration.png"" alt=""Hacker News node settings"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Hacker News node settings</i></figcaption></figure>


/// note | Renaming a node
You can rename the node with a name that's more descriptive for your use case. There are three ways to do this:

- Select the node you want to rename and at the same time press the F2 key on your keyboard.
- Double-click on the node to open the node window. Click on the name of the node in the top left corner of the window, rename it as you like, then click **Rename** to save the node under the new name.
- Right-click on the node and select the **Rename** option, or select the node and press F2 on your keyboard.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-renaming-a-node-from-the-keyboard.png"" alt=""Renaming a node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Renaming a node from the keyboard</i></figcaption></figure>
///

## 4. Execute the node

Select the **Test step** button in the node details window. You should see 10 results in the Output **Table** view.

<!--This screenshot needs updating now that the button says ""Test step"" rather than ""Execute node""-->
<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-results-in-table-view-for-the-hacker-news-node.png"" alt=""Results in Table view for the Hacker News node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Results in Table view for the Hacker News node</i></figcaption></figure>

### Node executions

/// note | Node execution
A node execution represents a run of that node to retrieve the specified data.
///

If a node executes successfully, a small green checkmark appears on top of the node in the canvas

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-successfully-executed-workflow.png"" alt=""Successfully executed workflow"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Successfully executed workflow</i></figcaption></figure>

If the parameters are configured correctly and everything works fine, the requested data displays in the node window in **Table**, **JSON**, and **Schema** format. You can switch between these views by selecting the one you want from the **Table|JSON|Schema** button at the top of the node window.

/// note | Table vs JSON views
The **Table** view is the default. It displays the requested data in a table, where the rows are the records and the columns are the available attributes of those records.
///

Here's our Hacker News output in JSON view:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-results-in-json-view-for-the-hacker-news-node.png"" alt=""Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node</i></figcaption></figure>

The node window displays more information about the node execution:

- Next to the **Output** title, notice a small icon (this will be a green checkmark if the node executed successfully). If you hover on it, you'll get two more pieces of information that can provide insights into the performance of each individual node in a workflow:
    - **Start Time**: When the node execution started
    - **Execution Time**: How long it took for the node to return the results from the moment it started executing
- Just below the **Output** title, you'll notice another piece of information: **10 items**.
This field displays the number of items (records) that the node request returned. In this example, it's expected to be 10, since this is the limit we set in step 2. But if you don't set a limit, it's useful to see how many records are actually returned.


/// warning | Error in nodes
A red warning icon on a node means that the node has errors. This might happen if the node credentials are missing or incorrect or the node parameters aren't configured correctly.
///
<figure style=""text-align:center;""><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/error-node.png"" alt=""Error in nodes"" style=""width:30%"" align=""center""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Error in nodes</i></figcaption></figure>

## 5. Save the workflow

Once you're finished editing the node, select **Back to canvas** to return to the main canvas.

By default, your workflow is automatically saved as ""My workflow.""

For this lesson, rename the workflow to be ""Hacker News workflow.""

/// note | Reminder
You can rename a workflow by clicking on the workflow's name at the top of the Editor UI.
///

Once you've renamed the workflow, be sure to save it.

There are two ways in which you can save a workflow:

- From the Canvas in Editor UI, click **Ctrl + S** or **Cmd + S** on your keyboard.
- Select the **Save** button in the top right corner of the Editor UI. You may need to leave the node editor first by clicking outside the dialog.

## Summary

Congratulations, you just built your first workflow! In this lesson, you learned how to use actions in app nodes, configure their parameters and settings, and save and execute your workflow.

In the next lesson, you'll meet your new client, Nathan, who needs to automate his sales reporting work. You will build a more complex workflow for his use case, helping him become more productive at work."

# Automating a (Real-world) Use Case

Meet Nathan 🙋. Nathan works as an Analytics Manager at ABCorp. His job is to support the ABCorp team with reporting and analytics. Being a true jack of all trades, he also handles several miscellaneous initiatives.

Some things that Nathan does are repetitive and mind-numbing. He wants to automate some of these tasks so that he doesn't burn out. As an **Automation Expert**, you are meeting with Nathan today to help him understand how he can offload some of his responsibilities to n8n.

## Understanding the scenario

**You 👩‍🔧:** Nice to meet you, Nathan. Glad to be doing this! What's a repetitive task that's error-prone and that you'd like to get off your plate first?

**Nathan 🙋:** Thanks for coming in! The most annoying one's gotta be the weekly sales reporting.

I have to collect sales data from our legacy data warehouse, which manages data from the main business processes of an organization, such as sales or production. Now, each sales order can have the status Processing or Booked. I have to calculate the sum of all the Booked orders and announce them in the company Discord every Monday. Then I have to create a spreadsheet of all the Processing sales so that the Sales Managers can review them and check if they need to follow up with customers.

This manual work is tough and requires high attention to detail to make sure that all the numbers are right. Inevitably, I lose my focus and mistype a number or I don't get to do it on time. I've been criticized once by my manager for miscalculating the data.

**You 👩‍🔧:** Oh no! Doesn't the data warehouse have a way to export the data?

**Nathan 🙋:** The data warehouse was written in-house ages ago. It doesn't have a CSV export but they recently added a couple of API endpoints that expose this data, if that helps.

**You 👩‍🔧:** Perfect! That's a good start. If you have a generic API, we can add some custom code and a couple of services to make an automated workflow. This gig has n8n written all over it. Let's get started!"

# Designing the Workflow

Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's consider the steps he needs to take to achieve this:

1. Get the relevant data (order id, order status, order value, employee name) from the data warehouse
2. Filter the orders by their status (Processing or Booked)
3. Calculate the total value of all the Booked orders
4. Notify the team members about the Booked orders in the company's Discord channel
5. Insert the details about the Processing orders in Airtable for follow-up
6. Schedule this workflow to run every Monday morning

Nathan's workflow involves sending data from the company's data warehouse to two external services:
- Discord
- Airtable

In between, the data has to be wrangled with general functions (conditional filtering, calculation, scheduling).

n8n provides integrations for all these steps, so Nathan's workflow in n8n would look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-four/l1-c4-nathans-workflow.png"" alt=""Finished workflow"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Nathan's workflow</i></figcaption></figure>

You will build this workflow in eight steps:

1. [Getting data from the data warehouse](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.1/)
2. [Inserting data into Airtable](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.2/)
3. [Filtering orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/)
4. [Setting values for processing orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.4/)
5. [Calculating booked orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.5/)
6. [Notifying the team](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.6/)
7. [Scheduling the workflow](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.7/)
8. [Activating and examining the workflow](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.8/)

To build this workflow, you will need the credentials that were sent in the email from n8n when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up already, you can do it [here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI?typeform-source=127.0.0.1){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}.

# Exporting and importing workflows

In this chapter, you will learn how to export and import workflows.

## Exporting and importing workflows

You can save n8n workflows locally as JSON files. This is useful if you want to share your workflow with someone else or import a workflow from someone else.

--8<-- ""_snippets/workflows/sharing-credentials.md""

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-six/l1-c6-import-export-menu.png"" alt=""Import/Export menu"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Import & Export workflows menu</i></figcaption></figure>

You can export and import workflows in two ways:

* From the **Editor UI**:
    * Export: From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right, then select **Download**. This will download your current workflow as a JSON file on your computer.
    * Import: From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right, then select **Import from URL** (to import a published workflow) or **Import from File** (to import a workflow as a JSON file).
* From the command line:
    * Export: See the [full list of commands ](/hosting/cli-commands/){:target=""_blank"" .external} for exporting workflows or credentials.
    * Import: See the [full list of commands ](/hosting/cli-commands/#import-workflows-and-credentials){:target=""_blank"" .external} for importing workflows or credentials.

<!--
## Sharing workflows

We love to see what users build with n8n and discover inspiring workflows! On the [n8n workflows page](https://n8n.io/workflows){:target=""_blank"" .external} you can find hundreds of workflows contributed by our team or community of users.

Since now you know how to build workflows, we encourage you to build more helpful and original workflows and share them with the community.

To share a workflow, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/login){:target=""_blank"" .external}.
2. Click on the **_+ Share New Workflow_** button.
3. Enter the name of your workflow in the **_Name_** field.
The name should be descriptive for the purpose of the workflow and easy for other users to understand.

4. In the **_Description_** field, add a screenshot of your workflow and write a description below it.
	* The screenshot should capture the entire Editor UI.
	* The description should list all the nodes used in the workflow and the function they serve. You should also mention any prerequisites for building the workflow.

    !!! tip  Workflow description template
        [This is an example](https://n8n.io/workflows/1110){:target=""_blank"" .external} of a well-written description that you can use as a template for your own workflows.


5. In the Editor UI, select all the nodes in your workflow (Ctrl + A or Cmd + A) and copy them (Ctrl + C or Cmd + C).
6. In the **_Workflow Code_** field, delete the existing code and paste your workflow (Ctrl + V or Cmd + V).
7. Click on the **_Publish Workflow to Share_** button to share your workflow.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-three/share-workflow.png"" alt=""Share workflow"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Share workflow</i></figcaption></figure>

Next, your workflow will be reviewed by our team. If it meets our guidelines, it will appear on the n8n workflows page for everyone to see and use!

# Level one: Introduction

Welcome to the **n8n Course Level 1**!


## Is this course right for me?

This course introduces you to the fundamental concepts within n8n and develops your low-code automation expertise.

This course is for you if you:

- Are starting to use n8n for the first time.
- Are looking for some extra help creating your first workflow.
- Want to automate processes in your personal or working life.


## What will I learn in this course?

We believe in learning by doing. You can expect some theoretical information about the basic concepts and components of n8n, followed by practice of building workflows step by step.

By the end of this course you will know:

- How to set up n8n and navigate the Editor UI.
- How n8n structures data.
- How to configure different node parameters and add credentials.
- When and how to use conditional logic in workflows.
- How to schedule and control workflows.
- How to import, download, and share workflows with others.

You will build two workflows:

- A two-node workflow to get articles from Hacker News
- A seven-node workflow to help your client get records from a data warehouse, filter them, make calculations, and notify team members about the results

## What do I need to get started?

1. **n8n set up**: You can use the [self-hosted version](/hosting/installation/npm/){:target=""_blank"" .external}, or [n8n Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview/){:target=""_blank"" .external}.
2. **A user ID**: [Sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI){:target=""_blank"" .external} to get your unique ID and other credentials you will need in the course.
3. Basic knowledge of JavaScript and [APIs](https://n8n.io/blog/what-are-apis-how-to-use-them-with-no-code/){:target=""_blank"" .external} would be helpful, but isn't necessary.
4. An [account on the n8n community forum](https://community.n8n.io/){:target=""_blank"" .external} if you wish to receive a profile badge and avatar upon successful completion

## How long does the course take?

Completing the course should take around **two hours**. You don't have to complete it in one go; feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready.

## How do I complete the course?

# 1. Getting data from the data warehouse

In this part of the workflow you will learn how to get data by making HTTP requests using the [**HTTP Request**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.

First, let's set up the scene for building Nathan's workflow.

## Create new workflow

Open your Editor UI and create a new workflow with one of the two possible commands:

- Select **Ctrl + Alt + N** or **Cmd + Option + N** on your keyboard.
- Open the left menu, navigate to **Workflows**, and select **Add workflow**.

Name this new workflow ""Nathan's workflow.""

The first thing you need to do is get data from ABCorp's old data warehouse.

In the previous chapter, you used an action node connected to a specific app (Hacker News). But not all apps or services have dedicated nodes, like the legacy data warehouse from Nathan's company.

Though we can't directly export the data, Nathan told us that the data warehouse has a couple of API endpoints. That's all we need to access the data using the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) in n8n.

/// note | No node for that service?
The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes, allowing you to make HTTP requests to query data from apps and services. You can use it to access data from apps or services that don't have a dedicated node in n8n.
///

## Add an HTTP Request node

Now, in your Editor UI, add an HTTP Request node like you learned in the lesson [Adding nodes](/courses/level-one/chapter-1/#adding-nodes). The node window will open, where you need to configure some parameters.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node.png"" alt=""HTTP Request node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>HTTP Request node</i></figcaption></figure>

This node will use credentials.

/// note | Credentials
Credentials are unique pieces of information that identify a user or a service and enable them to access apps or services (in our case, represented as n8n nodes). A common form of credentials is a username and a password, but they can take other forms depending on the service.
///

In this case, you'll need the credentials for the ABCorp data warehouse API included in the email from n8n you received when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up yet, [sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}.

In the Parameters of the HTTP Request node, make the following adjustments:

- **Method**: This should default to GET. Make sure it's set to GET.
- **URL**: Add the Dataset URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
- **Send Headers**: Toggle this control to true. In **Specify Headers**, ensure **Using Fields Below** is selected.
    - **Header Parameters** > **Name**: Enter `unique_id`.
    - **Header Parameters** > **Value**: The Unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
- **Authentication**: Select **Generic Credential Type**. This option requires credentials to allow you to access the data.
    - **Generic Auth Type**: Select **Header Auth**. (This field will appear after you select the Generic Credential Type for the Authentication.)
    - **Credential for Header Auth**: To add your credentials, select **Create New Credential**. This will open the Credentials window.
    - In the Credentials window, set **Name** to be the Header Auth name you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
    - In the Credentials window, set **Value** to be the Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
    - Click on the **Save** button in the Credentials window to save your credentials. Your **Credentials Connection** window should look like this:
    <figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node-credentials.png"" alt=""HTTP Request node credentials"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>HTTP Request node credentials</i></figcaption></figure>

/// note | Credentials naming
New credentials are named ""*node name* account"" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app/service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.
///

## Get the data

Select the **Test step** button in the HTTP Request node window. The result of the HTTP request should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node-window.png"" alt=""HTTP Request node output"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>HTTP Request node output</i></figcaption></figure>

This view should be familiar to you from the [Building a mini-workflow](/courses/level-one/chapter-2/).

This is the data from ABCorp's data warehouse that Nathan needs to work with. This data set includes sales information of 30 customers with five columns:

- `orderID`: The unique id of each order.
- `customerID`: The unique id of each customer.
- `employeeName`: The name of Nathan's colleague who is responsible for the customer.
- `orderPrice`: The total price of the customer's order.
- `orderStatus`: Whether the customer's order status is booked (booked) or still in processing (processing).

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: This is great! You already automated an important part of my job with only one node. Now instead of manually accessing the data every time I need it, I can use the HTTP Request Node to automatically get the information.

**You 👩‍🔧**: Exactly! In the next step, I'll help you one step further and insert the received data into Airtable, as you need it."

# 2. Inserting data into Airtable

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to insert the data received from the HTTP Request node into Airtable using the [Airtable node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/).

/// note | Spreadsheet nodes
You can replace the Airtable node with another spreadsheet app/service. For example, n8n also has a node for [**Google Sheets**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/).
///

After this step, your workflow should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-workflow-with-airtable-node.png"" alt=""Workflow with the Airtable node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow with the Airtable node</i></figcaption></figure>

## Configure your table

If we're going to insert data into Airtable, we first need to set up a table there. To do this:

1. [Create an Airtable account](https://airtable.com/signup){:target=""_blank"" .external}.
2. In your Airtable workspace add a new base from scratch and name it, for example, *beginner course*.

	<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-create-airtable-base.png"" alt=""Create an Airtable base"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Create an Airtable base</i></figcaption></figure>

3. In the beginner course base you have by default a **Table 1** with four fields: `Name`, `Notes`, `Assignee`, and `Status`.
These fields aren't relevant for us since they aren't in our orders data set. This brings us to the next point: the names of the fields in Airtable have to match the names of the columns in the node result.
  - Replace the four default table fields with the five column names from the data set, selecting **Number** field type for `orderID`, `customerID`, and `orderPrice`, and **Single line text** for `employeeName` and `orderStatus`.
  - Delete the 3 blank rows created by default.
  - Also, rename the table from **Table 1** to **orders** to make it easier to identify.

Now your table should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-orders-table.png"" alt=""Orders table in Airtable"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Orders table in Airtable</i></figcaption></figure>

Now that the table is ready, let's return to the workflow in the n8n Editor UI.

## Add an Airtable node to the HTTP Request node

Add an Airtable node connected to the HTTP Request node.

///note | Remember
You can add a node connected to an existing node by selecting the **+** icon next to the existing node.
///

In the node panel:

1. Search for Airtable.
2. Select **Create a record** from the **Record Actions** search results.

This will add the Airtable node to your canvas and open the node details window.

In the Airtable node window, configure the following parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**:
	- Select 'Create new credential'
	- Keep the default option 'Connect using: Access Token' selected
	- **Access token**: Follow the instructions [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/){:target=""_blank""} to create your token.
Adding credentials for Airtable is similar to the HTTP Request node you configured in the previous chapter. However, the process of obtaining an API key for Airtable (and other apps/services) is different.
- **Resource**: Record
- **Operation**: Create. This operation will create the new record in the table.
- **Base**: You can pick your base from a list(e.g beginner course), URL or ID after authenticating. If you wish to use the Base ID, go to [Airtable's API page](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction){:target=""_blank"" .external} and find the relevant base (located at the bottom of the page). Then click the base title and you'll find the ID on that page.
- **Table**: orders
- **Mapping Column Mode**: Map automatically. In this mode, the incoming data fields are named the same as the columns in Airtable

## Test the Airtable node

Once you've finished configuring the Airtable node, execute it by selecting **Test step**.

Your results should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-airtable-node.png"" alt=""Airtable node results"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Airtable node results</i></figcaption></figure>

All 30 data records will now appear in the orders table in Airtable:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-airtable-records.png"" alt=""Imported records in the orders table"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Imported records in the orders table</i></figcaption></figure>

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: Wow, this automation is really useful! But this inserts all collected data from the HTTP Request node into Airtable. Remember that I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table and calculate the price of booked orders?

**You 👩‍🔧**: Sure, no problem. As a next step, I'll use a new node to filter the orders based on their status."

# 3. Filtering Orders

In this step of the workflow you will learn how to filter data using conditional logic and how to use expressions in nodes using the If node.

To insert only processing orders into Airtable we need to filter our data by `orderStatus`. Basically, we want to tell the program that _if_ the `orderStatus` is processing, _then_ insert all records with this status into Airtable; _else_, for example, if the `orderStatus` isn't *processing*, calculate the sum of all orders with the other `orderStatus (booked)`.

This if-then-else command is conditional logic. In n8n workflows, conditional logic can be implemented with the [If node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/){:target=""_blank"" .external}, which splits a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.

/// note | If vs. Switch
If you need to filter data on more than two conditional routes that are possible with the If node (true and false), use the [Switch node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/){:target=""_blank"" .external}. The Switch node is similar to the If node, but supports multiple output routes.
///

## Remove the connection to the Airtable node

First, let's remove the connection between the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node:

1. Hover over the arrow connection the **HTTP Request** node and the **Airtable** node.
2. Select the trash icon to remove the connection.

## Configure the If node

With the connection to the Airtable node removed, add an If node connected to the HTTP Request node:

1. Select the **+** sign coming off the HTTP Request node.
2. Search for the If node.
3. Select it when it appears in the search.

For the If node, we'll use an expression.

/// note | Expressions
An expression is a string of characters and symbols in a programming language that represents a value depending upon its input. In n8n workflows, you can use expressions in a node to refer to another node for input data. In our example, the If node references the data output by the HTTP Request node.
///

In the If node window, configure the parameters:

- **Value 1**: `{{ $json.orderStatus }}`
    1. To select this value, first hover over the value1 field.
    2. Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the Value 1 field.
    3. Next, open the expression editor by selecting the link icon: 
    <figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-3-if-node-open-editor.png"" alt=""Opening the Expression Editor"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Opening the Expression Editor</i></figcaption></figure>
    4. Now use the **Variable Selector** navigation to open **Current Node** > **Input Data** > **JSON**.
    5. Select **orderStatus**.
    <figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-3-if-node-expression-editor.png"" alt=""Expression Editor in the IF node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Expression Editor in the If node</i></figcaption></figure>
    6. Once the Expression is added, close the **Edit Expression** dialog.

- **Operation**: **String** > **is equal to**
- **Value 2**: processing

/// warning | Data Type
Make sure to select the correct data type (boolean, date & time, number, or string) when you select the **Operation**.
///

Select **Test step** to test the If node.

Your results should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-3-if-node-output.png"" alt=""If node output"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>If node output</i></figcaption></figure>

Note that the orders with `orderStatus` equal to `processing` should show for the True Branch output, while the orders with `orderStatus` equal to `booked` should show in the False Branch output.

## Insert data into Airtable

Next, we want to insert this data into Airtable. Remember what Nathan said at the end of the [Inserting data into Airtable](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.2/) lesson?

> I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table...

Since Nathan only needs the `processing` orders in the table, we'll connect the Airtable node to the If node's `true` connector. 

In this case, since the Airtable node is already on our canvas, select the **HTTP Request** `true` connector and drag it to the Airtable node.

It's a good idea at this point to retest the Airtable node. Before you do, open your table in Airtable and delete all existing rows. Then open the Airtable node window in n8n and select **Test step**.

Review your data in Airtable to be sure your workflow only added the correct orders (those with orderStatus of `processing`).

At this stage, your workflow should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-3-workflow-with-if-node.png"" alt=""Workflow with the If node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow with the If node</i></figcaption></figure>

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: This If node is really useful for filtering data! Now I have all the information about processing orders. I actually only need the `employeeName` and `orderID`, but I guess I can keep all the other fields just in case.

**You 👩‍🔧**: Actually, I wouldn't recommend doing that. Inserting more data requires more computational power, the data transfer is slower and takes longer, and takes up more storage resources in your table. In this particular case, 14 records with 5 features might not seem like a lot to make a significant difference, but if your business grows to thousands of records and tens of features, things add up and even one extra column can affect performance.

**Nathan 🙋**: Oh, that's good to know. Can you select only two fields from the processing orders?

**You 👩‍🔧**: Sure, I'll do that in the next step."

# 4. Setting Values for Processing Orders

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to select and set data before transferring it to Airtable using the Edit Fields (Set) node.

The next step in Nathan's workflow is to insert the `employeeName` and `orderID` of all `processing` orders into Airtable.

For this, you need to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/), which allows you to select and set the data you want to transfer from one app/service to another.

/// note | Edit Fields node
The Edit Fields node can set completely new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values into spreadsheets or databases.
///

## Disconnect the Airtable node

In your workflow, disconnect the Airtable node** from the **If node in the same way we disconnected it in the [Filtering Orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/) lesson.

## Configure the Edit Fields node

Now add a new Edit Fields (Set) node** attached to the **If node's `true` connector by selecting the **+** icon with that connector and searching for **Edit Fields**.

With the Edit Fields node window open, configure these parameters:

- Ensure **Mode** is set to **Manual Mapping**.
- While you can use the **Expression editor** we used in the [Filtering Orders](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/) lesson, this time, let's drag the fields from the **Input** into the **Fields to Set**:
    - Drag **orderID** as the first field.
    - Drag **employeeName** as the second field.
- Ensure that **Include Other Input Fields** is set to false.

Select **Test step**. You should see the following results:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-4-set-node.png"" alt=""Edit Fields (Set) node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Edit Fields (Set) node</i></figcaption></figure>

## Add data to Airtable

Next, let's insert these values into Airtable:

1. Go to your Airtable account.
2. Add a new table called `processingOrders`. You can add this table to your existing workspace/table if you choose.
3. Add two columns to this table:
    - `orderID`: Number
    - `employeeName`: Single line text
    
    ///note | Reminder
    If you get stuck, refer back to the [Inserting data into Airtable](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.2/) lesson.
    ///
  
4. Be sure to delete the three empty rows in the new table!
5. With the new table created, update the Airtable node configuration to point to this new `processingOrders` table instead of the `orders` table.
6. Connect the Edit Fields node** connector to the **Airtable node.
7. Test your Airtable node to be sure it inserts records into the new `processingOrders` table.

At this stage, your workflow should now look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-4-workflow-with-set-node.png"" alt=""Workflow with the Edit Fields node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow with the Edit Fields node</i></figcaption></figure>

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: You've already automated half of my work! Now I still need to calculate the booked orders for my colleagues. Can that be automated as well?

**You 👩‍🔧**: Yes! In the next step, I'll use some JavaScript code in a node to calculate the booked orders."

# 5. Calculating Booked Orders

In this step of the workflow you will learn how n8n data is structured and how to add custom JavaScript code to perform calculations using the Code node.

The next step in Nathan's workflow is to calculate two values from the booked orders:

- The total number of booked orders
- The total value of all booked orders

To calculate data and add more functionality to your workflows you can use the Code node, which lets you write custom JavaScript code.

## About the Code node

/// warning | Code node modes
The Code node has two operational **Modes** that change the way it processes data. The **Run Once for All Items** mode allows you to accumulate data from all items on the input list. The **Run Once for Each Item** is used to add custom snippets of JavaScript code that should be executed once for every item that it receives as the input. Learn more about how to use the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).
///
- Create your own node.
- Write custom expressions.
- Use the Code node.
- Get the most out of n8n.

In n8n, the data that's passed between nodes is an array of objects with the following structure:

```json
[
    {
   	 // Each item has to contain a ""json"" property. But it can be an empty object like {}.
   	 // Any kind of JSON data is allowed. So arrays and the data being deeply nested is fine.
   	 json: { // The actual data n8n operates on (required)
   		 // This data is only an example, it could be any kind of JSON data
   		 apple: 'beets',
   		 carrot: {
   			 dill: 1
   		 }
   	 },
   	 // Binary data of item. Most items in n8n do not contain any (optional)
   	 binary: {
   		 // The key-name ""apple"" is only an example. Any kind of key-name is possible.
   		 apple-picture: {
   			 data: '....', // Base64 encoded binary data (required)
   			 mimeType: 'image/png', // Optional but should be set if possible (optional)
   			 fileExtension: 'png', // Optional but should be set if possible (optional)
   			 fileName: 'example.png', // Optional but should be set if possible (optional)
   		 }
   	 }
    },
    ...
]
```
## Configure the Code node

Now let's see how to implement this.

In your workflow, add a Code node** connected to the `false` branch of the **If node. 

With the Code node window open, configure these parameters:

- **Mode**: Select **Run Once for All Items**
- **Language**: Select **JavaScript**
- Copy the Code below and paste it into the **Code** box:
```javascript
let items = $input.all();
let totalBooked = items.length;
let bookedSum = 0;

for(let i=0; i < items.length; i++) {
  bookedSum = bookedSum + items[i].json.orderPrice;
}
return [{json:{totalBooked, bookedSum}}];
```

Notice the format in which we return the results of the calculation:<br>
`return [{json:{totalBooked, bookedSum}}]`

/// warning | Data structure error
If you don't use the correct data structure, you will get an error message: `Error: Always an Array of items has to be returned!`
///

Now select **Test step** and you should see the following results:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-5-code-node.png"" alt=""Code node output"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Code node output</i></figcaption></figure>

/// note | Using Python in code nodes
You can also use Python in the Code node. To learn more about this, refer to the [Code node](/code/code-node/) documentation.
///

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: Wow, the Code node is really powerful! This means that if I have some basic JavaScript skills I can power up my workflows.

**You 👩‍🔧**: Yes! You can progress from no-code to low-code!

**Nathan 🙋**: Now, how do I send the calculations for the booked orders to my team's Discord channel?

**You 👩‍🔧**: There's an n8n node for that. I'll set it up in the next step."

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to send messages to a Discord channel using the [Discord node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/).

Now that you have a calculated summary of the booked orders, you need to notify Nathan's team in their Discord channel. For this workflow, you will send messages to the [n8n server](https://discord.gg/G98WXzsjky){:target=""_blank"" .external} on Discord.

Before you begin the steps below, use the link above to connect to the n8n server on Discord. Be sure you can access the `#course-level-1` channel.

/// note | Communication nodes
You can replace the Discord node with another communication app. For example, n8n also has nodes for [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/){:target=""_blank"" .external} and [Mattermost](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/){:target=""_blank"" .external}.
///

In your workflow, add a Discord node connected to the Code node.

When you search for the Discord node, look for **Message Actions** and select **Send a message** to add the node.

In the Discord node window, configure these parameters:

- **Connection Type**: Select **Webhook**.
- **Credential for Discord Webhook**: Select **- Create New Credential -**.
    - Copy the **Webhook URL** from the email you received when you signed up for this course and paste it into the **Webhook URL** field of the credentials.
    - Select **Save** and then close the credentials dialog.
- **Operation**: Select **Send a Message**.
- **Message**:
    - Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the Message field.
    - Copy the text below and paste it into the **Expression** window, or construct it manually using the **Expression Editor**.
        - `This week we've {{$json[""totalBooked""]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json[""bookedSum""]}}. My Unique ID: {{ $('HTTP Request').params[""headerParameters""][""parameters""][0][""value""] }}`

        /// note | Constructing your own message
        To add the Unique ID portion of the statement, you'll need to expand **Nodes** > **HTTP Request** > **Parameters** > **headerParameters** > **parameters** > **[Item: 0]** and select the **value**.
        ///

Now select **Test step** in the Discord node. If all works well, you should see this output in n8n:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-6-discord-output.png"" alt=""Discord node output"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Discord node output</i></figcaption></figure>

And your message should appear in the Discord channel #course-level-1:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/discord-output.png"" alt=""Discord message"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Discord message</i></figcaption></figure>

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: Incredible, you've saved me so many hours of tedious work already! Now I can execute this workflow when I need it. I just need to remember to run it every Monday morning at 9 AM...

**You 👩‍🔧**: Don't worry about that, you can actually schedule the workflow to run on a specific day, time, or interval. I'll set this up in the next step."

# 7. Scheduling the Workflow

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to schedule your workflow so that it runs automatically at a set time/interval using the Schedule Trigger node.

The workflow you've built so far executes only when you click on **Test Workflow**. But Nathan needs it to run automatically every Monday morning. You can do this with the [Schedule Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), which allows you to schedule workflows to run periodically at fixed dates, times, or intervals.

To achieve this, we'll remove the Manual Trigger node we started with and replace it with a Schedule Trigger node instead.

## Remove the Manual Trigger node

First, let's remove the Manual Trigger node:

1. Select the Manual Trigger node connected to your HTTP Request node.
2. Select the trash can icon to delete.

The Manual Trigger node will be removed and you'll see an ""Add first step"" option.

## Add the Schedule Trigger node

1. Open the nodes panel and search for **Schedule Trigger**.
2. Select it when it appears in the search results.

In the Schedule Trigger node window, configure these parameters:

- **Trigger Interval**: Select **Weeks**.
- **Weeks Between Triggers**: Enter `1`.
- **Trigger on weekdays**: Select **Monday** (and remove **Sunday** if it was automatically added).
- **Trigger at Hour**: Select **9am**.
- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter `0`.

Your Schedule Trigger node should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-7-schedule-trigger-node.png"" alt=""Schedule Trigger Node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Schedule Trigger Node</i></figcaption></figure>

/// warning | Keep in mind
To ensure accurate scheduling with the Schedule Trigger node, be sure the timezone is set correctly for your [n8n instance](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) or the [workflow's settings](/workflows/settings/). The Schedule Trigger node will use the workflow's timezone if it's set; it will fall back to the n8n instance's timezone if it's not.
///

## Connect the Schedule Trigger node

Return to the canvas and connect your Schedule Trigger node to the HTTP Request node by dragging the arrow from it to the HTTP Request node.

Your full workflow should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-7-inactivated-workflow.png"" alt=""Full workflow"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Full workflow</i></figcaption></figure>

## What's next?

**You 👩‍🔧**: That was it for the workflow! I've added and configured all necessary nodes. Now every time you click on **Test workflow**, all nodes will be executed: getting, filtering, calculating, and transferring the sales data.

**Nathan 🙋**: This is just what I needed! My workflow will run automatically every Monday morning, correct?

**You 👩‍🔧**: Not so fast. To do that, you need to activate your workflow. I'll do this in the next step and show you how to interpret the execution log."

# 8. Activating and Examining the Workflow

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to activate your workflow and change the default workflow settings.

Activating a workflow means that it will run automatically every time a trigger node receives input or meets a condition. By default, all newly created workflows are deactivated.

To activate your workflow, set the **Inactive** toggle in the top navigation of the Editor UI to be **Activated**. Nathan's workflow will now be executed automatically every Monday at 9 AM:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-activated-workflow.png"" alt=""Activated workflow"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Activated workflow</i></figcaption></figure>

## Workflow Executions

An execution represents a completed run of a workflow, from the first to the last node. n8n logs workflow executions, allowing you to see if the workflow was completed successfully or not. The execution log is useful for debugging your workflow and seeing at what stage it runs into issues.

To see the execution log, in your Editor UI select **All executions** in the left panel. This will open the **Executions** window.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-execution-list.png"" alt=""Execution List"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Execution List</i></figcaption></figure>

The **Executions** window displays a table with the following information:

- **Name**: The name of the workflow
- **Started At**: The date and time when the workflow started
- **Status**: The status of the workflow (Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Cancelled, or Failed) and the amount of time it took the workflow to execute
- **Execution ID**: The ID of this workflow execution

/// note | Workflow execution status
You can filter the displayed **Executions** by workflow and by status (**Any Status**, **Failed**, **Cancelled**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**).
The information displayed here depends on which executions are configured to be saved in the [**Workflow Settings**](/workflows/settings/).
///


## Workflow Settings

You can customize your workflows and executions, or overwrite some of the global default settings in [**Workflow Settings**](/workflows/settings/).

Access these settings by selecting the three dots in the upper right corner of the Editor UI, then select **Settings**.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-workflow-settings.png"" alt=""Workflow Settings"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow Settings</i></figcaption></figure>

In the **Workflow Settings** window you can configure the following settings:

- [**Error Workflow**](/flow-logic/error-handling/): A workflow to run in case the execution of the current workflow fails.
- **This workflow can be called by**: Workflows that are allowed to call this workflow using the [Execute Workflow node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/).
- **Timezone**: The timezone to use in the current workflow. If not set, the global timezone (by default ""New York"") is used. This setting is particularly important for the [Schedule Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), as you want to make sure that the workflow gets executed at the right time.
- **Save failed production executions**: If the Execution data of the workflow should be saved when it fails. Default is to save.
- **Save successful production executions**: If the Execution data of the workflow should be saved when it succeeds. Default is to save.
- **Save manual executions**: If executions started from the Editor UI should be saved. Default is to save.
- **Save execution progress**: If the execution data of each node should be saved. If set to Save, you can resume the workflow from where it stopped in case of an error, though keep in mind that this might make the execution slower. Default is not to save.
- **Timeout Workflow**: Whether to cancel a workflow execution after a specific period of time. Default is not to timeout.


## What's next?

**You 👩‍🔧**: That was it! Now you have a 7-node workflow that will run automatically every Monday morning. You don't have to worry about remembering to wrangle the data. Instead, you can start your week with more meaningful or exciting work.

**Nathan 🙋**: This workflow is incredibly helpful, thank you! Now, what's next for you?

**You 👩‍🔧**: I'd like to build more workflows, share them with others, and use some workflows built by other people."

# Understanding the data structure

In this chapter, you will learn about the data structure of n8n and how to use the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/){:target=""_blank""} to transform data and simulate node outputs.


## Data structure of n8n

In a basic sense, n8n nodes function as an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool. The nodes allow you to access (extract) data from multiple disparate sources, modify (transform) that data in a particular way, and pass (load) it along to where it needs to be.

The data that moves along from node to node in your workflow must be in a format (structure) that can be recognized and interpreted by each node. In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects.

/// note | About array of objects
An array is a list of values. The array can be empty or contain several elements. Each element is stored at a position (index) in the list, starting at 0, and can be referenced by the index number. For example, in the array `[""Leonardo"", ""Michelangelo"", ""Donatello"", ""Raphael""];` the element `Donatello` is stored at index 2.

An object stores key-value pairs, instead of values at numbered indexes as in arrays. The order of the pairs isn't important, as the values can be accessed by referencing the key name. For example, the object below contains two properties (`name` and `color`):

```json
{
	name: 'Michelangelo',
	color: 'blue',
}
```

An array of objects is an array that contains one or more objects. For example, the array `turtles` below contains four objects:

```javascript
var turtles = [
	{
		name: 'Michelangelo',
		color: 'orange',
	},
	{
		name: 'Donatello',
		color: 'purple',
	},
	{
		name: 'Raphael',
		color: 'red',
	},
	{
		name: 'Leonardo',
		color: 'blue',
	}
];
```

You can access the properties of an object using dot notation with the syntax `object.property`. For example, `turtles[1].color` gets the color of the second turtle.
///


Data sent from one node to another is sent as an array of JSON objects. The elements in this collection are called items.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/explanation_items.png"" alt="""" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Items</i></figcaption></figure>

An n8n node performs its action on each item of incoming data.

<figure><img src=""/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Items in the Customer Datastore node</i></figcaption></figure>


## Creating data sets with the Code node

Now that you are familiar with the n8n data structure, you can use it to create your own data sets or simulate node outputs. To do this, use the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/){:target=""_blank""} to write JavaScript code defining your array of objects with the following structure:

```javascript
return [
	{
		json: {
			apple: 'beets',
		}
	}
];
```

For example, the array of objects representing the Ninja turtles would look like this in the Code node:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function_notnested.png"" alt="""" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Array of objects in the Code node</i></figcaption></figure>

/// warning | JSON objects
Notice that this array of objects contains an extra key: `json`. n8n expects you to wrap each object in an array in another object, with the key `json`.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/explanation_datastructure.png"" alt="""" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Illustration of data structure in n8n</i></figcaption></figure>

It's good practice to pass the data in the right structure used by n8n. But don't worry if you forget to add the `json` key to an item, n8n (version 0.166.0 and above) adds it automatically.
///

You can also have nested pairs, for example if you want to define a primary and a secondary color. In this case, you need to further wrap the key-value pairs in curly braces `{}`.

/// note | n8n data structure video
[This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQHT3Unn4tY) offers a more detailed explanation of data structure in n8n.

///


### Exercise

In a Code node, create an array of objects named `myContacts` that contains the properties `name` and `email`, and the `email` property is further split into `personal` and `work`.

??? note ""Show me the solution""

	In the **Code node**, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:

	```javascript
	var myContacts = [
		{
			json: {
				name: 'Alice',
				email: {
					personal: 'alice@home.com',
					work: 'alice@wonderland.org'
				},
			}
		},
		{
			json: {
				name: 'Bob',
				email: {
					personal: 'bob@mail.com',
					work: 'contact@thebuilder.com'
					},
			}
		},
	];

	return myContacts;
	```

	When you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:

	<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function.png"" alt="""" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Result of Code node</i></figcaption></figure>



## Referencing node data with the Code node

Just like you can use [expressions](/code/expressions/) to reference data from other nodes, you can also use some [methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) in the **Code node**.

Please make sure you read these pages before continuing to the next exercise.

### Exercise

Let's build on the previous exercise, in which you used the Code node to create a data set of two contacts with their names and emails. Now, connect a second Code node to the first one. In the new node, write code to create a new column named `workEmail` that references the work email of the first contact.

??? note ""Show me the solution""
	In the **Code node**, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:

	```javascript
	let items = $input.all();
	items[0].json.workEmail = items[0].json.email['work'];
	return items;
	```

	When you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:

	<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function_reference.png"" alt="""" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Code node reference</i></figcaption></figure>


## Transforming data

The incoming data from some nodes may have a different data structure than the one used in n8n. In this case, you need to [transform the data](/data/transforming-data/){:target=""_blank"" .external}, so that each item can be processed individually.

The two most common operations for data transformation are:

- Creating multiple items from one item
- Creating a single item from multiple items

There are several ways to transform data for the purposes mentioned above:

- Use n8n's [data transformation nodes](/data/#data-transformation-nodes). Use these nodes to modify the structure of incoming data that contain lists (arrays) without needing to use JavaScript code in the **Code node**:
	- Use the [**Split Out node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/) to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
	- Use the [**Aggregate node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
- Use the **Code node** to write JavaScript functions to modify the data structure of incoming data using the **Run Once for All Items** mode:
    - To create multiple items from a single item, you can use JavaScript code like this. This example assumes that the item has a key named `data` set to an array of items in the form of: `[{ ""data"": [{<item_1>}, {<item_2>}, ...] }]`:
	```javascript
	return $input.first().json.data.map(item => {
        return {
            json: item
        }
    });
	```
	- To create a single item from multiple items, you can use this JavaScript code:
	```javascript
    return [
    	{
        	json: {
        		data_object: $input.all().map(item => item.json)
        	}
        }
      ];
	```

These JavaScript examples assume your entire input is what you want to transform. As in the exercise above, you can also execute either operation on a specific field by identifying that in the items list, for example, if our workEmail example had multiple emails in a single field, we could run some code like this:
```javascript
let items = $input.all();
return items[0].json.workEmail.map(item => {
	return {
		json: item
	}
});
```

### Exercise

1. Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the Quotable API `https://api.quotable.io/quotes`. (This API requires no authentication).
2. Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Split Out node**.
3. Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Code node**.


??? note ""Show me the solution""

	1. To get the quotes from the Quotable API, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:
		- **Authentication**: None
		- **Request Method**: GET
		- **URL**: https://api.quotable.io/quotes
	2. To transform the data with the **Split Out node**, connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and set the following parameters:
		- **Field To Split Out**: results
		- **Include**: No Other Fields
	3. To transform the data with the **Code node**, connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and write the following code in the JavaScript Code field:
		```javascript
		let items = $input.all();
		return items[0].json.results.map(item => {
			return {
				json: item
			}
		});
		```"

# Processing different data types

In this chapter, you will learn how to process different types of data using [n8n core nodes](/workflows/components/nodes/).


## HTML and XML data

You're most likely familiar with HTML and XML.

/// note | HTML vs. XML
HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and semantics of a web page. XML looks similar to HTML, but the tag names are different, as they describe the kind of data they hold.
///
If you need to process HTML or XML data in your n8n workflows, use the [**HTML node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) or the [**XML node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).

Use the **HTML node** to extract HTML content of a webpage by referencing CSS selectors. This is useful if you want to collect structured information from a website (web-scraping).

### HTML Exercise

Let's get the title of the latest n8n blog post:

1. Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the URL `https://blog.n8n.io/` (this endpoint requires no authentication).
2. Connect an **HTML node** and configure it to extract the title of the first blog post on the page.
	- Hint: If you're not familiar with CSS selectors or reading HTML, the CSS selector `.item-title  a` should help!

??? note ""Show me the solution""

	1. Configure the HTTP Request node with the following parameters:
		- **Authentication**: None
		- **Request Method**: GET
		- **URL**: https://blog.n8n.io/
	The result should look like this:

	<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_httprequestnode.png"" alt=""Result of HTTP Request node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Result of HTTP Request node</i></figcaption></figure>

	2. Connect an **HTML node** to the **HTTP Request node** and configure the former's parameters:
		- **Operation**: Extract HTML Content
		- **Source Data**: JSON
		- **JSON Property**: data
		- **Extraction Values**:
			- **Key**: title
			- **CSS Selector**: `.item-title  a`
			- **Return Value**: HTML

	You can add more values to extract more data.

	The result should look like this:

	<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_htmlextractnode.png"" alt=""Result of HTML Extract node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Result of HTML Extract node</i></figcaption></figure>


Use the **XML node** to convert XML to JSON and JSON to XML. This operation is useful if you work with different web services that use either XML or JSON and need to get and submit data between them in the two formats.

### XML Exercise

In the [final exercise of Chapter 1](/courses/level-two/chapter-1/#exercise_2), you used an **HTTP Request node** to make a request to the Quotable API. In this exercise, we'll return to that same API but we'll convert the output to XML:

1. Add an **HTTP Request node** that makes the same request to the Quotable API at `https://api.quotable.io/quotes`.
2. Use the XML node to convert the JSON output to XML.

??? note ""Show me the solution""

	1. To get the quotes from the Quotable API, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:
		- **Authentication**: None
		- **Request Method**: GET
		- **URL**: https://api.quotable.io/quotes
	2. Connect an **XML node** to it with the following parameters:
		- **Mode**: JSON to XML
		- **Property name**: data

	The result should look like this:

	<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_xmlnode_table.png"" alt=""Table view of XML Node (JSON to XML)"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>XML node (JSON to XML) – Table View</i></figcaption></figure>

	To transform data the other way around, select the mode **XML to JSON**.


## Date, time, and interval data

Date and time data types include `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `YEAR`. The dates and times can be passed in different formats, for example:
<!-- vale off -->
- `DATE`: March 29 2022, 29-03-2022, 2022/03/29
- `TIME`: 08:30:00, 8:30, 20:30
- `DATETIME`: 2022/03/29 08:30:00
- `TIMESTAMP`: 1616108400 (Unix timestamp), 1616108400000 (Unix ms timestamp)
- `YEAR`: 2022, 22
<!-- vale on -->
There are a few ways you can work with dates and times:

- Use the [**Date & Time node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) to convert date and time data to different formats and calculate dates.
- Use [**Schedule Trigger node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) to schedule workflows to run at a specific time, interval, or duration.

Sometimes, you might need to pause the workflow execution. This might be necessary if you know that a service doesn't process the data instantly or it's slow to return all the results. In these cases, you don't want n8n to pass incomplete data to the next node.

If you run into situations like this, use the [**Wait node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) after the node that you want to delay. The **Wait node** pauses the workflow execution and will resume execution:

- At a specific time.
- After a specified time interval.
- On a webhook call.



### Date Exercise

Build a workflow that adds five days to an input date from the Customer Datastore node that you used before. Then, if the calculated date occurred after 1959, the workflow waits 1 minute before [setting](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) the calculated date as a value. The workflow should be triggered every 30 minutes.


To begin:
<!-- To do: need to figure out what the actual desired output is here since Date & Time options have changed and I'm unclear what the Set node should be doing-->
1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected. Return All.
2. Add the **Date & Time node** to Round Up the created Date from the datastore to End of Month. Output this to field new-date. Include all input fields.
3. Add the **If node** to check if that new rounded date is after `1960-01-01 00:00:00`.
4. Add the **Wait node** to the True output of that node and set it to wait for one minute.
5. Add the **Edit Fields (Set) node** to set a new field called outputValue to a String containing new-date. Include all input fields.
6. Add the **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow to trigger it every 30 minutes. (You can keep the [Manual Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) for testing!)

??? note ""Show me the solution""

	1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected.
		- Select the option to **Return All**.
	2. Add a **Date & Time node** connected to the Customer Datastore node. Select the option to **Round a Date**.
		- Add the `created` date as the **Date** to round.
		- Select `Round Up` as the **Mode** and `End of Month` as the **To**.
		- Set the **Output Field Name** as `new-date`.
		- In **Options**, select **Add Option** and use the control to **Include Input Fields**
	3. Add an **If node** connected to the **Date & Time node**.
		- Add the new-date field as the first part of the condition.
		- Set the comparison to **Date &Time > is after**
		- Add `1960-01-01 00:00:00` as the second part of the expression. (This should produce 3 items in the True Branch and 2 items in the False Branch)
	4. Add a **Wait node** to the True output of the **If node**.
		- Set **Resume** to `After Time interval`.
		- Set **Wait Amount** to `1.00`.
		- Set **Wait Unit** to `Minutes`.
	5. Add an **Edit Fields (Set) node** to the **Wait node**.
		- Use either JSON or Manual Mapping **Mode**.
		- Set a new field called `outputValue` to be the value of the new-date field.
		- Select the option to **Include Other Input Fields** and include **All** fields.
	6. Add a **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow.
		- Set the **Trigger Interval** to use `Minutes`.
		- Set the **Minutes Between Triggers** to 30.
		- To test your schedule, be sure to activate the workflow.
		- Be sure to connect this node to the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** you began with!

	The workflow should look like this:

## Binary data

Up to now, you have mainly worked with text data. But what if you want to process data that's not text, like images or PDF files? These types of files are represented in the binary numeral system, so they're considered binary data. In this form, binary data doesn't offer you useful information, so you'll need to convert it into a readable form.

In n8n, you can process binary data with the following nodes:

- [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to request and send files from/to web resources and APIs.
- [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
- [Convert to File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
- [Extract From File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

/// note | Reading and writing files is only available on self-hosted n8n
Reading and writing files to disk isn't available on n8n Cloud. You'll read and write to the machine where you installed n8n. If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host. The Read/Write Files From Disk node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors.
///

To read or write a binary file, you need to write the path (location) of the file in the node's `File(s) Selector` parameter (for the Read operation) or in the node's `File Path and Name` parameter (for the Write operation).

/// warning | Naming the right path
The file path looks slightly different depending on how you are running n8n:

- npm: `~/my_file.json`
- n8n cloud / Docker: `/tmp/my_file.json`
///



### Binary Exercise 1

For our first binary exercise, let's convert a PDF file to JSON:

1. Make an HTTP request to get this PDF file: `https://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_Whitepaper_Anti_blocker.pdf.`
2. Use the **Extract From File node** to convert the file from binary to JSON.

??? note ""Show me the solution""

	In the **HTTP Request node**, you should see the PDF file, like this:

	<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_binarydata_httprequest_file.png"" alt=""HTTP Request node to get PDF"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>HTTP Request node to get PDF</i></figcaption></figure>

	When you convert the PDF from binary to JSON using the **Extract From File node**, the result should look like this:

	}
	```



### Binary Exercise 2

For our second binary exercise, let's convert some JSON data to binary:

1. Make an HTTP request to the Poetry DB API `https://poetrydb.org/random/1`.
2. Convert the returned data from JSON to binary using the **Convert to File node**.
3. Write the new binary file data to the machine where n8n is running using the **Read/Write Files From Disk node**.
4. To check that it worked out, use the **Read/Write Files From Disk node** to read the generated binary file.

# Merging and splitting data

In this chapter, you will learn how to merge and split data, and in what cases it might be useful to perform these operations.


## Merging data

In some cases, you might need to merge (combine) and process data from different sources.

Merging data can involve:

- Creating one data set from multiple sources.
- Synchronizing data between multiple systems. This could include removing duplicate data or updating data in one system when it changes in another.

/// note | One-way vs. two-way sync
In a one-way sync, data is synchronized in one direction. One system serves as the single source of truth. When information changes in that main system, it automatically changes in the secondary system; but if information changes in the secondary system, the changes aren't reflected in the main system.

In a two-way sync, data is synchronized in both directions (between both systems). When information changes in either of the two systems, it automatically changes in the other one as well.

[This blog tutorial](https://n8n.io/blog/how-to-sync-data-between-two-systems/) explains how to sync data one-way and two-way between two CRMs.
///


In n8n, you can merge data from two different nodes using the [Merge node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/){:target=""_blank""}, which provides several merging options:

- [Append](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#append){:target=""_blank""}
- [Combine](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine){:target=""_blank""}
	- [Merge by Fields](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#merge-by-fields){:target=""_blank""}: requires input fields to match on
	- [Merge by Position](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#merge-by-position){:target=""_blank""}
	- [Multiplex](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#multiplex){:target=""_blank""}
- [Choose Branch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#choose-branch){:target=""_blank""}

Notice that Combine > Merge by Fields requires you enter input fields to match on. These fields should contain identical values between the data sources so n8n can properly match data together. In the **Merge node**, they're called `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/explanation_mergepropertyinput.png"" alt=""Property Input fields in the Merge node"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Property Input fields in the Merge node</i></figcaption></figure>

/// warning | Property Input in dot notation
If you want to reference nested values in the **Merge node** parameters `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`, you need to enter the property key in dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).
///

/// note
You can also find the **Merge node** under the alias Join. This might be more intuitive if you're familiar with SQL joins.
///

### Merge Exercise

Build a workflow that merges data from the Customer Datastore node and Code node.

1. Add a **Merge node** that takes `Input 1` from a **Customer Datastore node** and `Input 2` from a **Code node**.
2. In the **Customer Datastore node**, run the operation **Get All People**.
3. In the **Code node**, create an array of two objects with three properties: `name`, `language`, and `country`, where the property `country` has two sub-properties `code` and `name`.
	- Fill out the values of these properties with the information of two characters from the Customer Database.
	- For example, Jay Gatsby's language is English and country name is United States.
4. In the **Merge node**, try out different merge options.

??? note ""Show me the solution""

	The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

	<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/exercise_merge.png"" alt=""Workflow exercise for merging data"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow exercise for merging data</i></figcaption></figure>

	If you merge data with the option **Keep Matches** using the name as the input fields to match, the result should look like this (note this example only contains Jay Gatsby; yours might look different depending on which characters you selected):

	<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/exercise_merge_kkm.png"" alt=""Output of Merge node with option to keep matches"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Output of Merge node with option to keep matches</i></figcaption></figure>

## Looping

In some cases, you might need to perform the same operation on each element of an array or each data item (for example sending a message to every contact in your address book). In technical terms, you need to iterate through the data (with loops).

n8n generally handles this repetitive processing automatically, as the nodes run once for each item, so you don't need to build loops into your workflows.

However, there are some [exceptions of nodes and operations](/flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions){:target=""_blank""} that will require you to build a loop into your workflow.

To [create a loop in an n8n workflow](/flow-logic/looping/#using-loops-in-n8n){:target=""_blank""}, you need to connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node, and add an **If node** to check when to stop the loop.

## Splitting data in batches

If you need to process large volumes of incoming data, execute the **Code node** multiple times, or avoid API rate limits, it's best to split the data into batches (groups) and process these batches.

For these processes, use the [**Loop Over Items node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/){:target=""_blank""}. This node splits input data into a specified batch size and, with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data.

/// warning | Execution of Loop Over Items node
The **Loop Over Items node** stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow, so it's not necessary to add an **If node** to stop the loop.
///

### Loop/Batch Exercise

Build a workflow that reads the RSS feed from Medium and dev.to. The workflow should consist of three nodes:

1. A **Code node** that returns the URLs of the RSS feeds of Medium (`https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io`) and dev.to (`https://dev.to/feed/n8n`).
2. A **Loop Over Items node** with `Batch Size: 1`, that takes in the inputs from the **Code node** and **RSS Read node** and iterates over the items.
3. An **RSS Read node** that gets the URL of the Medium RSS feed, passed as an expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.
	- The **RSS Read node** is one of the [exception nodes](/flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions){:target=""_blank""} which processes only the first item it receives, so the **Loop Over Items node** is necessary for iterating over multiple items.

??? note ""Show me the solution""

	1. Add a **Code Node**. You can format the code in several ways, one way is:
		- Set **Mode** to `Run Once for All Items`.
		- Set **Language** to `JavaScript`.
		- Copy the code below and paste it into the JavaScript Code editor:
			```javascript
			let urls = [
				{
					json: {
					url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io'
					}
				},
				{
				json: {

			return urls;
			```
	2. Add a **Loop Over Items node** connected to the **Code node**.
		- Set **Batch Size** to `1`.
	3. The **Loop Over Items node** automatically adds a node called ""Replace Me"". Replace that node with an **RSS Read node**.
		- Set the **URL** to use the url from the Code Node: `{{ $json.url }}`.

# Dealing with errors in workflows

Sometimes you build a nice workflow, but it fails when you try to execute it. Workflow executions may fail for a variety of reasons, ranging from straightforward problems with incorrectly configuring a node or a failure in a third-party service to more mysterious errors.

But don't panic. In this lesson, you'll learn how you can troubleshoot errors so you can get your workflow up and running as soon as possible.


## Checking failed workflows

n8n tracks executions of your workflows.

When one of your workflows fails, you can check the Executions log to see what went wrong. The Executions log shows you a list of the latest execution time, status, mode, and running time of your saved workflows.

Open the Executions log by selecting [**Executions**](/editor-ui/#executions) in the left-side panel. 

To investigate a specific failed execution from the list, select the name or the **View** button that appears when you hover over the row of the respective execution.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/explanation_workflowexecutions.png"" alt=""Executions log"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Executions log</i></figcaption></figure>


This will open the workflow in read-only mode, where you can see the execution of each node. This representation can help you identify at what point the workflow ran into issues.

To toggle between viewing the execution and the editor, select the **Editor | Executions** button at the top of the page.

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/explanation_workflowexecutions_readonly.png"" alt=""Workflow execution view"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow execution view</i></figcaption></figure>

## Catching erroring workflows

To catch failed workflows, create a separate [**Error Workflow**](/flow-logic/error-handling/error-workflows/) with the [**Error Trigger node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/). This workflow will only execute if the main workflow execution fails.

Use additional nodes in your **Error Workflow** that make sense, like sending notifications about the failed workflow and its errors using email or Slack.

To receive error messages for a failed workflow, set the **Error Workflow** in the [Workflow Settings](/workflows/settings/) to an Error Workflow that uses an **Error Trigger node**.

The only difference between a regular workflow and an Error Workflow is that the latter contains an **Error Trigger node**. Make sure to create this node before you set this as another workflow's designated Error Workflow.

/// note | Error workflows
- If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
- If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
- You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.
- You can set the same Error Workflow for multiple workflows.
///

### Exercise

In the previous chapters, you've built several small workflows. Now, pick one of them that you want to monitor and create an Error Workflow for it:

1. Create a new Error Workflow.
2. Add the **Error Trigger node**.
3. Connect a node for the communication platform of your choice to the Error Trigger node, like [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/), [Discord](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/), [Telegram](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/), or even [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) or a more generic [Send Email](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/).
4. In the workflow you want to monitor, open the [Workflow Settings](/workflows/settings/) and select the new Error Workflow you just created. Note that this workflow needs to run automatically to trigger the error workflow.

??? note ""Show me the solution""

	The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

	<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/exercise_errors_errortriggernode_workflow.png"" alt="""" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Error workflow</i></figcaption></figure>

	To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

	```json
	{
		""nodes"": [
			{
				""parameters"": {},
				""name"": ""Error Trigger"",
				""type"": ""n8n-nodes-base.errorTrigger"",
				""typeVersion"": 1,
				""position"": [
					720,
					-380
				]
			},
			{
				""parameters"": {
					""channel"": ""channelname"",
					""text"": ""=This workflow {{$node[\""Error Trigger\""].json[\""workflow\""][\""name\""]}}failed.\nHave a look at it here: {{$node[\""Error Trigger\""].json[\""execution\""][\""url\""]}}"",
					""attachments"": [],
					""otherOptions"": {}
				},
				""name"": ""Slack"",
				""type"": ""n8n-nodes-base.slack"",
				""position"": [
					900,
					-380
				],
				""typeVersion"": 1,
				""credentials"": {
					""slackApi"": {
						""id"": ""17"",
						""name"": ""slack_credentials""
					}
				}
			}
		],
		""connections"": {
			""Error Trigger"": {
				""main"": [
					[
						{
							""node"": ""Slack"",
							""type"": ""main"",
							""index"": 0
						}
					]
				]
			}
		}
	}
	```



## Throwing exceptions in workflows

Another way of troubleshooting workflows is to include a [**Stop and Error node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) in your workflow. This node throws an error. You can specify the error type:

- **Error Message**: returns a custom message about the error
- **Error Object**: returns the type of error

You can only use the **Stop and Error node** as the last node in a workflow.

/// note | When to throw errors
Throwing exceptions with the **Stop and Error node** is useful for verifying the data (or assumptions about the data) from a node and returning custom error messages.

If you are working with data from a third-party service, you may come across problems such as:

- Wrongly formatted JSON output
- Data with the wrong type (for example, numeric data that has a non-numeric value)
- Missing values
- Errors from remote servers

Though this kind of invalid data might not cause the workflow to fail right away, it could cause problems later on, and then it can become difficult to track the source error. This is why it's better to throw an error at the time you know there might be a problem.

# Level two: Introduction

Welcome to the **n8n Course Level 2**!


## Is this course right for me?

This course is for you if you:

- Want to automate somewhat complex business processes.
- Want to dive deeper into n8n after taking the [Level 1 course](/courses/level-one/).

## What will I learn in this course?

The focus in this course is on working with data. You will learn how to:

- Use the data structure of n8n correctly.
- Process different data types (for example, XML, HTML, date, time, and binary data).
- Merge data from different sources (for example, a database, spreadsheet, or CRM).
- Use functions and JavaScript code in the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code).
- Deal with error workflows and workflow errors.

You will learn all this by completing short practical exercises after the theoretical explanations and building a business workflow following instructions.

## What do I need to get started?

To follow along this course (at a comfortable pace) you will need the following:

- **n8n set up**: You can use the [self-hosted version](/hosting/installation/npm/) or [n8n Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview/).
- **A user ID**: [Sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/HQoQ7nXg){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} to get your unique ID and other credentials you will need in the course.
- **Basic n8n skills**: We strongly recommend taking the [Level 1 course](/courses/level-one/) before this one.
- **Basic JavaScript understanding**

## How long does the course take?

Completing the course should take around **two hours**. You don't have to complete it in one go; feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready.

## How do I complete the course?

There are two milestones in this course that test your knowledge of what you have learned in the lessons:

- [x] Building the [main workflow](/courses/level-two/chapter-5/chapter-5.0/)
- [x] Passing the [quiz](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/r9hDbytg){:target=""_blank"" .external} at the end of the course

# Automating a business workflow

Remember [our friend Nathan](/courses/level-one/chapter-3)?

**Nathan 🙋:** Hello, it's me again. My manager was so impressed with my first workflow automation solution that she entrusted me with more responsibility.<br/>
**You 👩‍🔧:** More work and responsibility. Congratulations, I guess. What do you need to do now?<br/>
**Nathan 🙋:** I got access to all our sales data and I'm now responsible for creating two reports: one for regional sales and one for orders prices. They're based on data from different sources and come in different formats.<br/>
**You 👩‍🔧:** Sounds like a lot of manual work, but the kind that can be automated. Let's do it!


## Workflow design

Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's list the steps he needs to take to achieve this:

1. Get and combine data from all necessary sources.
2. Sort the data and format the dates.
3. Write binary files.
4. Send notifications using email and Discord.

n8n provides [core nodes](/integrations/builtin/node-types/#core-nodes) for all these steps. This use case is somewhat complex. We should build it from three separate workflows:

1. A workflow that merges the company data with external information.
2. A workflow that generates the reports.
3. A workflow that monitors errors in the second workflow.

## Workflow prerequisites

To build the workflows, you will need the following:

* An [Airtable](https://airtable.com/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} account and [credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/).
* A [Google](https://www.google.com/account/about/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} account and [credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) to access Gmail.
* A [Discord](https://discord.com/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} account and webhook URL (you receive this using email when you sign up for this course).

Next, you will build these three workflows with step-by-step instructions."

# Workflow 1: Merging data

Nathan's company stores its customer data in Airtable. This data contains information about the customers' ID, country, email, and join date, but lacks data about their respective region and subregion. You need to fill in these last two fields in order to create the reports for regional sales.

To accomplish this task, you first need to make a copy of this table in your Airtable account:

<iframe class=""airtable-embed"" src=""https://airtable.com/embed/shrNX9tjPkVLABbNz?backgroundColor=orange&viewControls=on"" frameborder=""0"" onmousewheel="""" width=""100%"" height=""533"" style=""background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;""></iframe>

Next, build a small workflow that merges data from Airtable and a REST Countries API:

1. Use the [**Airtable node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) to list the data in the Airtable table named `customers`.
2. Use the [**HTTP Request node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get data from the REST Countries API: `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`. This will return data about world countries, split out into separate items.
3. Use the [**Merge node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) to merge data from Airtable and the Countries API by country name, represented as `customerCountry` in Airtable and `name.common` in the Countries API, respectively.
4. Use another Airtable node to update the fields `region` and `subregion` in Airtable with the data from the Countries API.

The workflow should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow1.png"" alt=""Workflow 1 for merging data from Airtable and the Countries API"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow 1 for merging data from Airtable and the Countries API</i></figcaption></figure>


/// question | Quiz questions
* How many items does the **HTTP Request node** return?
* How many items does the **Merge node** return?
* How many unique regions are assigned in the customers table?
* What's the subregion assigned to the customerID 10?

# Workflow 2: Generating reports

In this workflow, you will merge data from different sources, transform binary data, generate files, and send notifications about them. The final workflow should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2.png"" alt=""Workflow 2 for aggregating data and generating files"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow 2 for aggregating data and generating files</i></figcaption></figure>

To make things easier, let's split the workflow into three parts.

## Part 1: Getting data from different sources

The first part of the workflow consists of five nodes:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2_1.png"" alt=""Workflow 1: Getting data from different sources"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow 1: Getting data from different sources</i></figcaption></figure>

1. Use the [**HTTP Request node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get data from the API endpoint that stores company data. Configure the following node parameters:

    - **Method**: Get
    - **URL**: The **Dataset URL** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
    - **Authentication**: Generic Credential Type
        - **Generic Auth Type**: Header Auth
        - **Credentials for Header Auth**: The Header Auth name and Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
    - **Send Headers**: Toggle to true
        - **Specify Headers**: Select `Using Fields Below`
        - **Name**: `unique_id`
        - **Value**: The unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.

2. Use the [**Airtable node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) to list data from the `customers` table (where you updated the fields `region` and `subregion`).
3. Use the [**Merge node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) to merge data from the Airtable and HTTP Request node, based on matching the input fields for `customerID`.
4. Use the [**Sort node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/) to sort data by `orderPrice` in descending order.

/// question | Quiz questions
* What's the name of the employee assigned to customer 1?
* What's the order status of customer 2?
* What's the highest order price?
///

## Part 2: Generating file for regional sales

The second part of the workflow consists of four nodes:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2_2.png"" alt=""Workflow 2: Generating file for regional sales"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow 2: Generating file for regional sales</i></figcaption></figure>

1. Use the [**If node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) to filter to only display orders from the region `Americas`.
2. Use the [**Convert to File**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to transform the incoming data from JSON to binary format. Convert each item to a separate file. (Bonus points if you can figure out how to name each report based on the orderID!)
3. Use the [**Gmail node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) (or another email node) to send the files using email to an address you have access to. Note that you need to add an attachment with the data property.
4. Use the [**Discord node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) to send a message in the n8n Discord channel `#course-level-two`. In the node, configure the following parameters:
    * **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
    * **Text**: ""I sent the file using email with the label ID `{label ID}`. My ID: "" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course. <br/> Note that you need to replace the text in curly braces `{}` with expressions that reference the data from the nodes.

/// question | Quiz questions
* How many orders are assigned to the `Americas` region?
* What's the total price of the orders in the `Americas` region?
* How many items does the **Write Binary File node** return?
///

## Part 3: Generating files for total sales

The third part of the workflow consists of five nodes:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow2_3.png"" alt=""Workflow 3: Generating files for total sales"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow 3: Generating files for total sales</i></figcaption></figure>

1. Use the [**Loop Over Items node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) to split data from the Item Lists node into batches of 5.
2. Use the [**Set node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) to set four values, referenced with expressions from the previous node: `customerEmail`, `customerRegion`, `customerSince`, and `orderPrice`.
3. Use the [**Date & Time node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) to change the date format of the field `customerSince` to the format MM/DD/YYYY.
    - Set the **Include Input Fields** option to keep all the data together.
4. Use the [**Convert to File node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to create a CSV spreadsheet with the file name set as the expression: `{{$runIndex > 0 ? 'file_low_orders':'file_high_orders'}}`.
5. Use the [**Discord node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) to send a message in the n8n Discord channel `#course-level-two`. In the node, configure the following parameters:
    * **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
    * **Text**: ""I created the spreadsheet `{file name}`. My ID:"" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course. <br/> Note that you need to replace `{file name}` with an expression that references data from the previous **Convert to File node**.<br/>

/// question | Quiz questions
* What's the lowest order price in the first batch of items?
* What's the formatted date of customer 7?
* How many items does the **Convert to File node** return?
///

# Workflow 3: Monitoring workflow errors

Last but not least, let's help Nathan know if there are any errors running the workflow.

To accomplish this task, create an Error workflow that monitors the main workflow:

1. Create a new workflow.
2. Add an **Error Trigger node** (and execute it as a test).
3. Connect a **Discord node** to the **Error Trigger node** and configure these fields:<br/>

	* **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL that you received in the email from n8n when you signed up for this course.
	* **Text**: ""The workflow `{workflow name}` failed, with the error message: `{execution error message}`. Last node executed: `{name of the last executed node}`. Check this workflow execution here: `{execution URL}` My Unique ID: "" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.

		Note that you need to replace the text in curly brackets `{}` with expressions that take the respective information from the Error Trigger node.<br/>

4. Execute the Discord node.
5. Set the newly created workflow as the **Error Workflow** for the main workflow you created in the previous lesson.

The workflow should look like this:

<figure><img src=""/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow3.png"" alt=""Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors"" style=""width:100%""><figcaption align = ""center""><i>Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors</i></figcaption></figure>

/// question | Quiz questions
* What fields does the **Error Trigger node** return?
* What information about the execution does the **Error Trigger node** return?
* What information about the workflow does the **Error Trigger node** return?
* What's the expression to reference the workflow name?

# Create and edit credentials

Credentials are securely stored authentication information used to connect n8n workflows to external services such as APIs, or databases.

## Create a credential

1. Select the <span class=""inline-image"">![universal create resource icon](/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png){.off-glb}</span> **button** in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select credential. 
2. If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the credential inside your personal space or a specific project you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll create the credential inside your personal space.
3. Select the app or service you wish to connect to.

Or:

1. Using the <span class=""inline-image"">![universal create resource icon](/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png){.off-glb}</span> **Create** button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific project. Select Credential.
2.  If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the credential inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the credential inside that specific project.
3. Select the app or service you wish to connect to.

You can also create new credential in the credential drop down when editing a node on the workflow editor.

Once in the credential modal, enter the details required by your service. Refer to your service's page in the [credentials library](/integrations/builtin/credentials/) for guidance.

When you save a credential, n8n tests it to confirm it works.

/// note | Credentials naming
n8n names new credentials ""*node name* account"" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app or service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.
///

## Expressions in credentials

You can use expressions to set credentials dynamically as your workflow runs:

1. In your workflow, find the data path containing the credential. This varies depending on the exact parameter names in your data. Make sure that the data containing the credential is available in the workflow when you get to the node that needs it.
1. When creating your credential, hover over the field where you want to use an expression.
1. Toggle **Expression** on.
1. Enter your expression.

# Credential sharing


/// info | Feature availability
Available on all Cloud plans, and Enterprise self-hosted plans.
///

You can share a credential directly with other users to use in their own workflows. Or share a credential in a project for all members of that project to use. Any users using a shared credential won't be able to view or edit the credential details.

Users can share credentials they created and own. Only project admins can share credentials created in and owned by a project. Instance owners and instance admins can view and share all credentials on an instance.

Refer to [Account types](/user-management/account-types/) for more information about owners and admins.

In [projects](/user-management/rbac/), a user's role controls how they can interact with the workflows and credentials associated to the projects they're a member of.

## Share a credential

To share a credential: 

1. From the left menu, select either **Overview** or a project.
2. Select **Credentials** to see a list of your credentials.
3. Select the credential you want to share.
4. Select **Sharing**.
5. In the **Share with projects or users** dropdown, browse or search for the user or project with which you want to share your credentials.
6. Select a user or project. 
7. Select **Save** to apply the changes.

## Remove access to a credential

To unshare a credential:

1. From the left menu, select either **Overview** or a project.
2. Select **Credentials** to see a list of your credentials.
3. Select the credential you want to unshare.
4. Select **Sharing**.
5. Select **trash icon**<span class=""inline-image"">![Trash icon](/_images/common-icons/delete-node.png){.off-glb}</span> on the user or project you want to remove from the list of shared users and projects.

# Binary data

Binary data is any file-type data, such as image files or documents.

This page collects resources relating to binary data in n8n.

## Working with binary data in your workflows

You can process binary data in n8n workflows. n8n provides nodes to help you work with binary data. You can also use code.

### Nodes

There are three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:

- [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
- [Convert to File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
- [Extract From File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

There are separate nodes for working with XML and HTML data:

* [HTML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/)
* [XML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/)

And nodes for performing common tasks:

* [Compression](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.compression/)
* [Edit Image](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.editimage/)
* [FTP](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ftp/)

You can trigger a workflow based on changes to a local file using the [Local File trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.localfiletrigger/).

To split or concatenate binary data items, use the [data transformation nodes](/data/#data-transformation-nodes).

### Code

You can use the [Code node](/code/code-node/) to manipulate binary data in your workflows. For example, [Get the binary data buffer](/code/cookbook/code-node/get-binary-data-buffer/): get the binary data available in your workflow.


## Configure binary data mode when self-hosting

You can configure how your self-hosted n8n instance handles binary data using the [Binary data environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/binary-data). This includes tasks such as setting the storage path and choosing how to store binary data.

Your configuration affects how well n8n scales: [Scaling | Binary data filesystem mode](/hosting/scaling/binary-data/).

Reading and writing binary files can have security implications. If you want to disable reading and writing binary data, use the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information."

# Processing data with code

## Function

A function is a block of code designed to perform a certain task. In n8n, you can write custom JavaScript or Python code snippets to add, remove, and update the data you receive from a node.

The [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node gives you access to the incoming data and you can manipulate it. With this node you can create any function you want using JavaScript code."

# Data editing

n8n allows you to edit [pinned data](/data/data-pinning/). This means you can check different scenarios without setting up each scenario and sending the relevant data from your external system. It makes it easier to test edge cases.

/// note | For development only
Data editing isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.
///
## Edit output data

To edit output data:

1. Run the node to load data.
2. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
3. Select **Edit** <span class=""inline-image"">![Edit data icon](/_images/data/data-pinning/edit-data.png){.off-glb}</span>.
4. Edit your data.
5. Select **Save**. n8n saves your data changes and pins your data.

## Use data from previous executions

You can copy data from nodes in previous workflow executions:

1. Open the left menu.
2. Select **Executions**.
3. Browse the workflow executions list to find the one with the data you want to copy.
4. Select **Open Past Execution** <span class=""inline-image"">![Open past execution icon](/_images/data/data-pinning/open-execution.png){.off-glb}</span>.
5. Double click the node whose data you want to copy.
6. If it's table layout, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
7. There are two ways to copy the JSON:
  1. Select the JSON you want by highlighting it, like selecting text. Then use `ctrl` + `c` to copy it.
  2. Select the JSON you want to copy by clicking on a parameter. Then:
    1. Hover over the JSON. n8n displays the **Copy** <span class=""inline-image"">![Copy data icon](/_images/data/data-pinning/copy-data.png){.off-glb}</span> button.
    2. Select **Copy** <span class=""inline-image"">![Copy data icon](/_images/data/data-pinning/copy-data.png){.off-glb}</span>.
    3. You can choose what to copy:
        * **Copy Item Path** and **Copy Parameter Path** gives you expressions that access parts of the JSON.
        * **Copy Value**: copies the entire selected JSON.
8. Return to the workflow you're working on:  
    1. Open the left menu.
    2. Select **Workflows**.
    3. Select **Open**.
    4. Select the workflow you want to open.
9. Open the node where you want to use the copied data.
10. If there is no data, run the node to load data.
11. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view. 
12. Select **Edit** <span class=""inline-image"">![Edit data icon](/_images/data/data-pinning/edit-data.png){.off-glb}</span>.
15. Paste in the data from the previous execution.
16. Select **Save**. n8n saves your data changes and pins your data."

# Data mocking

Data mocking is simulating or faking data. It's useful when developing a workflow. By mocking data, you can:

- Avoid making repeated calls to your data source. This saves time and costs.
- Work with a small, predictable dataset during initial development.
- Avoid the risk of overwriting live data: in the early stages of building your workflow, you don't need to connect your real data source.


## Mocking with real data using data pinning

Using [data pinning](/data/data-pinning/), you load real data into your workflow, then pin it in the output panel of a node. Using this approach you have realistic data, with only one call to your data source. You can [edit pinned data](/data/data-editing/).

Use this approach when you need to configure your workflow to handle the exact data structure and parameters provided by your data source.

--8<-- ""_snippets/data/how-to-pin-data.md""


## Generate custom data using the Code or Edit Fields nodes

You can create a custom dataset in your workflow using either the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) or the [Edit Fields (Set) node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/).

In the Code node, you can create any data set you want, and return it as the node output. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add fields** to add your custom data.

The Edit Fields node is a good choice for small tests. To create more complex datasets, use the Code node.

## Output a sample data set from the Customer Datastore node

The Customer Datastore node provides a fake dataset to work with. Add and execute the node to explore the data.

Use this approach if you need some test data when exploring n8n, and you don't have a real use-case to work with."

# Data pinning

You can 'pin' data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. 

You can use this when working with data from external sources to avoid having to repeat requests to the external system. This can save time and resources:

* If your workflow relies on an external system to trigger it, such as a webhook call, being able to pin data means you don't need to use the external system every time you test the workflow.
* If the external resource has data or usage limits, pinning data during tests avoids consuming your resource limits.
* You can fetch and pin the data you want to test, then have confidence that the data is consistent in all your workflow tests.

You can only pin data for nodes that have a single main output (""error"" outputs don't count for this purpose).

/// note | For development only
Data pinning isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.
///

## Pin data

--8<-- ""_snippets/data/how-to-pin-data.md""

## Unpin data

When data pinning is active, a banner appears at the top of the node's output panel indicating that n8n has pinned the data. To unpin data and fetch fresh data on the next execution, select the **Unpin** link in the banner."

#https://www.notion.so/n8n/Frontmatter-432c2b8dff1f43d4b1c8d20075510fe4
contentType: explanation

# Data structure

In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. It has the following structure:

```json
[
	{
		// For most data:
		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'json'
		""json"": {
			// Example data
			""apple"": ""beets"",
			""carrot"": {
				""dill"": 1
			}
		},
		// For binary data:
		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'binary'
		""binary"": {
			// Example data
			""apple-picture"": {
				""data"": ""...."", // Base64 encoded binary data (required)
				""mimeType"": ""image/png"", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
				""fileExtension"": ""png"", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
				""fileName"": ""example.png"", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
			}
		}
	},
]
```

/// note | Skipping the `json` key and array syntax
From 0.166.0 on, when using the Function node or Code node, n8n automatically adds the `json` key if it's missing. It also automatically wraps your items in an array (`[]`) if needed. This is only the case when using the Function or Code nodes. When building your own nodes, you must still make sure the node returns data with the `json` key.

# Data

Data is the information that n8n nodes receive and process. For basic usage of n8n you don't need to understand data structures and manipulation. However, it becomes important if you want to:

 - Create your own node
 - Write custom expressions
 - Use the Function or Function Item node

This section covers: 

* [Data structure](/data/data-structure/)
* [Data flow within nodes](/data/data-flow-nodes/)
* [Transforming data](/data/transforming-data/)
* [Process data using code](/data/code/)
* [Pinning](/data/data-pinning/) and [editing](/data/data-editing/) data during workflow development.
* [Data mapping](/data/data-mapping/) and [Item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): how data items link to each other.

## Related resources

### Data transformation nodes

n8n provides a collection of nodes to transform data:

* [Aggregate](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
* [Limit](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
* [Remove Duplicates](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
* [Sort](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
* [Split Out](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
* [Summarize](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables."

# Transforming data

n8n uses a predefined [data structure](/data/data-structure/) that allows all nodes to process incoming data correctly.

Your incoming data may have a different data structure, in which case you will need to transform it to allow each item to be processed individually.

For example, the image below shows the output of an [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node that returns data incompatible with n8n's data structure. The node returns the data and displays that only one item was returned.

![HTTP Request node output](/_images/data/transforming-data/HTTPRequest_output.png)

To transform this kind of structure into the n8n data structure you can use the data transformation nodes:

* [Aggregate](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
* [Limit](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
* [Remove Duplicates](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
* [Sort](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
* [Split Out](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.

# Mapping in the expressions editor

These examples show how to access linked items in the expressions editor. Refer to [expressions](/code/expressions/) for more information on expressions, including built in variables and methods.

For information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).

## Access the linked item in a previous node's output

When you use this, n8n works back up the item linking chain, to find the parent item in the given node.

```js
// Returns the linked item
{{$(""<node-name>"").item}}
```

As a longer example, consider a scenario where a node earlier in the workflow has the following output data:

```json
[
  {
    ""id"": ""23423532"",
    ""name"": ""Jay Gatsby"",
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423533"",
    ""name"": ""José Arcadio Buendía"",
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423534"",
    ""name"": ""Max Sendak"",
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423535"",
    ""name"": ""Zaphod Beeblebrox"",
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423536"",
    ""name"": ""Edmund Pevensie"",
  }
]
```

To extract the name, use the following expression:

```js
{{$(""<node-name>"").item.json.name}}
```


### Access the linked item in the current node's input

In this case, the item linking is within the node: find the input item that the node links to an output item.

```js
// Returns the linked item
{{$input.item}}
```

As a longer example, consider a scenario where the current node has the following input data:

```json
[
  {
    ""id"": ""23423532"",
    ""name"": ""Jay Gatsby"",
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423533"",
    ""name"": ""José Arcadio Buendía"",
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423534"",
    ""name"": ""Max Sendak"",
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423535"",
    ""name"": ""Zaphod Beeblebrox"",
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423536"",
    ""name"": ""Edmund Pevensie"",
  }
]
```

To extract the name, you'd normally use drag-and-drop [Data mapping](/data/data-mapping/), but you could also write the following expression:

```js
{{$input.item.json.name}}
```"

# Mapping in the UI

Data mapping means referencing data from previous nodes. It doesn't include changing (transforming) data, just referencing it.

You can map data in the following ways:

* Using the expressions editor.
* By dragging and dropping data from the **INPUT** into parameters. This generates the expression for you.

For information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).

## How to drag and drop data

1. Run your workflow to load data.
2. Open the node where you need to map data.
3. You can map in table, JSON, and schema view:
	* In table view: click and hold a table heading to map top level data, or a field in the table to map nested data.
	* In JSON view: click and hold a key. 
	* In schema view: click and hold a key.
4. Drag the item into the field where you want to use the data.

### Understand what you're mapping with drag and drop

Data mapping maps the key path, and loads the key's value into the field. For example, given the following data:

```js
[
	{
		""fruit"": ""apples"",
		""color"": ""green""
	}
]
```

You can map `fruit` by dragging and dropping **fruit** from the **INPUT** into the field where you want to use its value. This creates an expression, `{{ $json.fruit }}`. When the node iterates over input items, the value of the field becomes the value of `fruit` for each item.

### Understand nested data

Given the following data:

```js
[
  {
    ""name"": ""First item"",
    ""nested"": {
      ""example-number-field"": 1,
      ""example-string-field"": ""apples""
    }

# Data item linking

An item is a single piece of data. Nodes receive one or more items, operate on them, and output new items. Each item links back to previous items. 

You need to understand this behavior if you're:

* Building a programmatic-style node that implements complex behaviors with its input and output data.
* Using the Code node or expressions editor to access data from earlier items in the workflow. 
* Using the Code node for complex behaviors with input and output data.

This section provides:

* A conceptual overview of [Item linking concepts](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/). 
* Information on [Item linking for node creators](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/).

# Item linking concepts

Each output item created by a node includes metadata that links them to the input item (or items) that the node used to generate them. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. This can be complicated to understand, especially if the node splits or merges data. You need to understand item linking when building your own programmatic nodes, or in some scenarios using the Code node. 

This document provides a conceptual overview of this feature. For usage details, refer to:

* [Item linking for node creators](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/), for details on how to handle item linking when building a node.
* [Item linking in the Code node](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/), to learn how to handle item linking in the Code node.
* [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/), to understand the errors you may encounter in the editor UI.

## n8n's automatic item linking

If a node doesn't control how to link input items to output items, n8n tries to guess how to link the items automatically:

* Single input, single output: the output links to the input.
* Single input, multiple outputs: all outputs link to that input.
* Multiple inputs and outputs:
	* If you keep the input items, but change the order (or remove some but keep others), n8n can automatically add the correct linked item information.
	* If the number of inputs and outputs is equal, n8n links the items in order. This means that output-1 links to input-1, output-2 to input-2, and so on.
	* If the number isn't equal, or you create completely new items, n8n can't automatically link items.

If n8n can't link items automatically, and the node doesn't handle the item linking, n8n displays an error. Refer to [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/) for more information.

## Item linking example

![A diagram showing the threads linking multiple items back through a workflow](/_images/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-multiple-lines.png)

In this example, it's possible for n8n to link an item in one node back several steps, despite the item order changing. This means the node that sorts movies alphabetically can access information about the linked item in the node that gets famous movie actors.

The methods for accessing linked items are different depending on whether you're using the UI, expressions, or the code node. Explore the following resources:

* [Mapping in the UI](/data/data-mapping/data-mapping-ui/)
* [Mapping in the expressions editor](/data/data-mapping/data-mapping-expressions/)
* [Item linking in the Code node](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/)
* [Item linking errors](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/)"

# Item linking errors

In n8n you can reference data from any previous node. This doesn't have to be the node just before: it can be any previous node in the chain. When referencing nodes further back, you use the expression syntax `$(node_name).item`. 

<figure markdown>
![A diagram showing the threads linking multiple items back through a workflow](/_images/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-multiple-lines.png)
<figcaption markdown>Diagram of threads for different items. Due to the item linking, you can get the actor for each movie using `$('Get famous movie actors').item`.</figcaption>
</figure>

Since the previous node can have multiple items in it, n8n needs to know which one to use. When using `.item`, n8n figures this out for you behind the scenes. Refer to [Item linking concepts](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) for detailed information on how this works.

`.item` fails if information is missing. To figure out which item to use, n8n maintains a thread back through the workflow's nodes for each item. For a given item, this thread tells n8n which items in previous nodes generated it. To find the matching item in a given previous node, n8n follows this thread back until it reaches the node in question.

When using `.item`, n8n displays an error when:

- The thread is broken
- The thread points to more than one item in the previous node (as it's unclear which one to use)

To solve these errors, you can either avoid using `.item`, or fix the root cause.

You can avoid `.item` by using `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. They require you to know the position of the item that you’re targeting within the target node's output items. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](/code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.

The fix for the root cause depends on the exact error.

### Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'

If you see this error message:

> ERROR: Info for expression missing from previous node

There's a node in the chain that doesn't return pairing information. The solution here depends on the type of the previous node:

- Code nodes: make sure you return which input items the node used to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking in the code node](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/) for more information.
- Custom or community nodes: the node creator needs to update the node to return which input items it uses to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking for node creators](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/) for more information.

### Fix for 'Multiple matching items for expression'

This is the error message:

> ERROR: Multiple matching items for expression

Sometimes n8n uses multiple items to create a single item. Examples include the Summarize, Aggregate, and Merge nodes. These nodes can combine information from multiple items.

When you use `.item` and there are multiple possible matches, n8n doesn't know which one to use. To solve this you can either:

- Use `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](/code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.
- Reference a different node that contains the same information, but doesn't have multiple matching items."

# Configuration

--8<-- ""_snippets/embed-license.md""

## Authentication

You can secure n8n by setting up [User management](/user-management/), n8n's built-in authentication feature.

n8n supports [LDAP](/user-management/ldap/) and [SAML](/user-management/saml/).

### Credential overwrites

To offer OAuth login to users, it's possible to overwrite credentials on a global basis. This credential data isn't visible to users but the backend uses it automatically.

In the Editor UI, n8n hides all overwritten fields by default. This means that users are able to authenticate using  OAuth by pressing the ""connect"" button on the credentials.

n8n offers two ways to apply credential overwrites: using Environment Variable and using the REST API.

#### Using environment variables

You can set credential overwrites using environment variable by setting the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA` to `{ CREDENTIAL_NAME: { PARAMETER: VALUE }}`.

/// warning
Even though this is possible, it isn't recommended. Environment variables aren't protected in n8n, so the data can leak to users.
///

#### Using REST APIs

The recommended way is to load the data using a custom REST endpoint. Set the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT` to a path under which this endpoint should be made available.

/// note
The endpoints can be called just one at a time for security reasons.
///

For example:

1. Activate the endpoint by setting the environment variable in the environment n8n runs under:

    ```sh
    export CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT=send-credentials
    ```

2. A JSON file with the credentials to overwrite is then needed. For example, a `oauth-credentials.json` file to overwrite credentials for Asana and GitHub could look like this:

    ```json
    {
        ""asanaOAuth2Api"": {
            ""clientId"": ""<id>"",
            ""clientSecret"": ""<secret>""
        },
        ""githubOAuth2Api"": {
            ""clientId"": ""<id>"",
            ""clientSecret"": ""<secret>""
        }
    }
    ```

3. Then apply it to the instance by sending it using curl:

    ```sh
    curl -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" --data @oauth-credentials.json http://localhost:5678/send-credentials
    ```

/// note
There are cases when credentials are based on others. For example, the `googleSheetsOAuth2Api` extends the `googleOAuth2Api`.
In this case, you can set parameters on the parent credentials (`googleOAuth2Api`) for all child-credentials (`googleSheetsOAuth2Api`) to use.
///

## Environment variables

n8n has many [environment variables](/reference/environment-variables/) you can configure. Here are the most relevant environment variables for your hosted solution:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` | Number | `-1` | Sets a default timeout (in seconds) to all workflows after which n8n stops their execution. Users can override this for individual workflows up to the duration set in `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX`. Set `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` to `-1` to disable. |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` | Boolean | `true` | Whether to delete data of past executions on a rolling basis. |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` | Number | `336` | The execution age (in hours) before it's deleted. |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` | Number | `10000` | Maximum number of executions to keep in the database. 0 = no limit |
| `NODES_EXCLUDE` | Array of strings | - | Specify which nodes not to load. For example, to block nodes that can be a security risk if users aren't trustworthy: `NODES_EXCLUDE: ""[\""n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\"", \""n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\""]""` |
| `NODES_INCLUDE` | Array of strings | - | Specify which nodes to load. |
| `N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` | Boolean | `true` | Enable workflow templates (true) or disable (false). |
| `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST` | String | `https://api.n8n.io` | Change this if creating your own workflow template library. Note that to use your own workflow templates library, your API must provide the same endpoints and response structure as n8n's. Refer to [Workflow templates](/workflows/templates/) for more information. |

## Backend hooks

It's possible to define external hooks that n8n executes whenever a specific operation runs. You can use these, for example, to log data, change data, or forbid an action by throwing an error.

### Available hooks

| Hook     | Arguments | Description |
| :------- | :---------| :---------- |
| `credentials.create` | `[credentialData: ICredentialsDb]` | Called before new credentials get created. Use to restrict the number of credentials. |
| `credentials.delete` | `[id: credentialId]` | Called before credentials get deleted. |
| `credentials.update` | `[credentialData: ICredentialsDb]` | Called before existing credentials are saved. |
| `frontend.settings` | `[frontendSettings: IN8nUISettings]` | Gets called on n8n startup. Allows you to, for example, overwrite frontend data like the displayed OAuth URL. |
| `n8n.ready` | `[app: App]` | Called once n8n is ready. Use to, for example, register custom API endpoints. |
| `n8n.stop` |  | Called when an n8n process gets stopped. Allows you to save some process data. |
| `oauth1.authenticate` | `[oAuthOptions: clientOAuth1.Options, oauthRequestData: {oauth_callback: string}]` | Called before an OAuth1 authentication. Use to overwrite an OAuth callback URL. |
| `oauth2.callback` | `[oAuth2Parameters: {clientId: string, clientSecret: string \| undefined, accessTokenUri: string, authorizationUri: string, redirectUri: string, scopes: string[]}]` | Called in an OAuth2 callback. Use to overwrite an OAuth callback URL. |
| `workflow.activate` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowDb]` | Called before a workflow gets activated. Use to restrict the number of active workflows. |
| `workflow.afterDelete` | `[workflowId: string]` | Called after a workflow gets deleted. |
| `workflow.afterUpdate` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called after an existing workflow gets saved. |
| `workflow.create` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called before a workflow gets created. Use to restrict the number of saved workflows. |
| `workflow.delete` | `[workflowId: string]` | Called before a workflow gets delete. |
| `workflow.postExecute` | `[run: IRun, workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called after a workflow gets executed. |
| `workflow.preExecute` | `[workflow: Workflow: mode: WorkflowExecuteMode]` | Called before a workflow gets executed. Allows you to count or limit the number of workflow executions. |
| `workflow.update` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called before an existing workflow gets saved. |

### Registering hooks

Set hooks by registering a hook file that contains the hook functions.
To register a hook, set the environment variable `EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES`.

You can set the variable to a single file:

`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook.js`

Or to contain multiple files separated by a semicolon:

`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook1.js;/data/hook2.js`

### Backend hook files

Hook files are regular JavaScript files that have the following format:

```js
module.exports = {
    ""frontend"": {
        ""settings"": [
            async function (settings) {
                settings.oauthCallbackUrls.oauth1 = 'https://n8n.example.com/oauth1/callback';
                settings.oauthCallbackUrls.oauth2 = 'https://n8n.example.com/oauth2/callback';
            }
        ]
    },
    ""workflow"": {
        ""activate"": [
            async function (workflowData) {
                const activeWorkflows = await this.dbCollections.Workflow.count({ active: true });

                if (activeWorkflows > 1) {
                    throw new Error(
                        'Active workflow limit reached.'
                    );
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Backend hook functions

A hook or a hook file can contain multiple hook functions, with all functions executed one after another.

If the parameters of the hook function are objects, it's possible to change the data of that parameter to change the behavior of n8n.

You can also access the database in any hook function using `this.dbCollections` (refer to the code sample in [Backend hook files](#backend-hook-files).

## Frontend external hooks

Like backend external hooks, it's possible to define external hooks in the frontend code that get executed by n8n whenever a user performs a specific operation. You can use them, for example, to log data and change data.

### Available hooks

| Hook     | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| `credentialsEdit.credentialTypeChanged` | Called when an existing credential's type changes. |
| `credentials.create` | Called when someone creates a new credential. |
| `credentialsList.dialogVisibleChanged` |  |
| `dataDisplay.nodeTypeChanged` |  |
| `dataDisplay.onDocumentationUrlClick` | Called when someone selects the help documentation link. |
| `execution.open` | Called when an existing execution opens. |
| `executionsList.openDialog` | Called when someone selects an execution from existing Workflow Executions. |
| `expressionEdit.itemSelected` |  |
| `expressionEdit.dialogVisibleChanged` |  |
| `nodeCreateList.filteredNodeTypesComputed` |  |
| `nodeCreateList.nodeFilterChanged` | Called when someone makes any changes to the node panel filter. |
| `nodeCreateList.selectedTypeChanged` |  |
| `nodeCreateList.mounted` |  |
| `nodeCreateList.destroyed` |  |
| `nodeSettings.credentialSelected` |  |
| `nodeSettings.valueChanged` |  |
| `nodeView.createNodeActiveChanged` |  |
| `nodeView.addNodeButton` |  |
| `nodeView.createNodeActiveChanged` |  |
| `nodeView.mount` |  |
| `pushConnection.executionFinished` |  |
| `showMessage.showError` |  |
| `runData.displayModeChanged` |  |
| `workflow.activeChange` |  |
| `workflow.activeChangeCurrent` |  |
| `workflow.afterUpdate` | Called when someone updates an existing workflow. |
| `workflow.open` |  |
| `workflowRun.runError` |  |
| `workflowRun.runWorkflow` | Called when a workflow executes. |
| `workflowSettings.dialogVisibleChanged` |  |
| `workflowSettings.saveSettings` | Called when someone saves the settings of a workflow. |

### Registering hooks

You can set hooks by loading the hooks script on the page. One way to do this is by creating a hooks file in the project and adding a script tag in your `editor-ui/public/index.html` file:

```html
<script src=""frontend-hooks.js""></script>
```

### Frontend hook files

Frontend external hook files are regular JavaScript files which have the following format:

```js
window.n8nExternalHooks = {
  nodeView: {
    mount: [
      function (store, meta) {
        // do something
      },
    ],
    createNodeActiveChanged: [
      function (store, meta) {
        // do something
      },
      function (store, meta) {
        // do something else
      },
    ],
    addNodeButton: [
      function (store, meta) {
        // do something
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Frontend hook functions

You can define multiple hook functions per hook. Each hook function is invoked with the following arguments arguments:

* `store`: The Vuex store object. You can use this to change or get data from the store.
* `metadata`: The object that contains any data provided by the hook. To see what's passed, search for the hook in the `editor-ui` package."

# Deployment

--8<-- ""_snippets/embed-license.md""

See the [hosting documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/server-setup.html) for detailed setup options.

## User data

n8n recommends that you follow the same or similar practices used internally for n8n Cloud: Save user data using [Rook](https://rook.io/) and, if an n8n server goes down, a new instance starts on another machine using the same data.

Due to this, you don't need to use backups except in case of a catastrophic failure, or when a user wants to reactivate their account within your prescribed retention period (two weeks for n8n Cloud).

## Backups

n8n recommends creating nightly backups by attaching another container, and copying all data to this second container. In this manner, RAM usage is negligible, and so doesn't impact the amount of users you can place on the server.

## Restarting

If your instance is down or restarting, missed executions (for example, Cron or Webhook nodes) during this time aren't recoverable. If it's important for you to maintain 100% uptime, you need to build another proxy in front of it which caches the data."

# Workflow management in Embed

--8<-- ""_snippets/embed-license.md""

When managing an embedded n8n deployment, spanning across teams or organizations, you will likely need to run the same (or similar) workflows for multiple users. There are two available options for doing so:

| Solution | Pros | Cons |
| -------- | ---- | ---- |
| Create a workflow for each user | No limitation on how workflow starts (can use any trigger) | Requires managing multiple workflows. |
| Create a single workflow, and pass it user credentials when executing | Simplified workflow management (only need to change one workflow). | To run the workflow, your product must call it |



/// warning
The APIs referenced in this document are subject to change at any time. Be sure the check for continued functionality with each version upgrade.
///

## Workflow per user

There are three general steps to follow:

* Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow.
* Create the n8n credentials for this user.
* Create the workflow.

### 1. Obtain user credentials

Here you need to capture all credentials for any node/service this user must authenticate with, along with any additional parameters required for the particular workflow. The credentials and any parameters needed will depend on your workflow and what you are trying to do.

### 2. Create user credentials

After all relevant credential details have been obtained, you can proceed to create the relevant service credentials in n8n. This can be done using the Editor UI or API call.


#### Using the Editor UI

1. From the menu select **Credentials** > **New**.
1. Use the drop-down to select the **Credential type** to create, for example *Airtable*.
    ![Create New Credentials drop-down](/_images/embed/managing-workflows/create_new_credentials.png)
1. In the **Create New Credentials** modal, enter the corresponding credentials details for the user, and select the nodes that will have access to these credentials.
    ![Create New Credentials modal](/_images/embed/managing-workflows/create_new_credentials2.png)
1. Click **Create** to finish and save.

#### Using the API

The frontend API used by the Editor UI can also be called to achieve the same result. The API endpoint is in the format: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials`.

For example, to create the credentials in the Editor UI example above, the request would be:
```
POST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials
```

With the request body:
```json
{
   ""name"":""MyAirtable"",
   ""type"":""airtableApi"",
   ""nodesAccess"":[
      {
         ""nodeType"":""n8n-nodes-base.airtable""
      }
   ],
   ""data"":{
      ""apiKey"":""q12we34r5t67yu""
   }
}
```

The response will contain the ID of the new credentials, which you will use when creating the workflow for this user:
```json
{
   ""data"":{
      ""name"":""MyAirtable"",
      ""type"":""airtableApi"",
      ""data"":{
         ""apiKey"":""q12we34r5t67yu""
      },
      ""nodesAccess"":[
         {
            ""nodeType"":""n8n-nodes-base.airtable"",
            ""date"":""2021-09-10T07:41:27.770Z""
         }
      ],
      ""id"":""29"",
      ""createdAt"":""2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z"",
      ""updatedAt"":""2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z""
   }
}
```

### 3. Create the workflow

Best practice is to have a “base” workflow that you then duplicate and customize for each new user with their credentials (and any other details).

You can duplicate and customize your template workflow using either the Editor UI or API call.

#### Using the Editor UI

1. From the menu select **Workflows** > **Open** to open the template workflow to be duplicated.

1. Select **Workflows** > **Duplicate**, then enter a name for this new workflow and click **Save**.
    ![Duplicate workflow](/_images/embed/managing-workflows/duplicate_workflow.png)

1. Update all relevant nodes to use the credentials for this user (created above).

1. **Save** this workflow set it to **Active** using the toggle in the top-right corner.

#### Using the API

1. Fetch the JSON of the template workflow using the endpoint: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/<workflow_id>`
```

}
```

1. Save the returned JSON data and update any relevant credentials and fields for the new user.

1. Create a new workflow using the updated JSON as the request body at endpoint: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows`
``` 
POST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/
```

The response will contain the ID of the new workflow, which you will use in the next step.

1. Lastly, activate the new workflow:
```
PATCH https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/1012
```

Passing the additional value `active` in your JSON payload:
```json
// ...
""active"":true,
""settings"": {},
""staticData"": null,
""tags"": []
```

## Single workflow

There are four steps to follow to implement this method:

* Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow. See [Obtain user credentials](#obtain-user-credentials) above.
* Create the n8n credentials for this user. See [Create user credentials](#create-user-credentials) above.
* Create the workflow.
* Call the workflow as needed.

### Create the workflow

The details and scope of this workflow will vary greatly according to the individual use case, however there are a few design implementations to keep in mind:

* This workflow must be triggered by a [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.
* The incoming webhook call must contain the user’s credentials and any other workflow parameters required.
* Each node where the user’s credentials are needed should use an [expression](/code/expressions/) so that the node’s credential field reads the credential provided in the webhook call.
* Save and activate the workflow, ensuring the production URL is selected for the Webhook node. Refer to [webhook node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) for more information.

### Call the workflow

For each new user, or for any existing user as may be needed, call the webhook defined as the workflow trigger and provide the necessary credentials (and any other workflow parameters)."

# Prerequisites

--8<-- ""_snippets/embed-license.md""

The requirements provided here are an example based on n8n Cloud and are for illustrative purposes only. Your requirements may vary depending on the number of users, workflows, and executions. Contact n8n for more information.

| Component | Sizing | Supported |
| :-------- | :----- | :-------- |
| CPU/vCPU  | Minimum 10 CPU cycles, scaling as needed | Any public or private cloud |
| Database  | 512 MB - 4 GB SSD | SQLite or PostgreSQL |
| Memory    | 320 MB - 2 GB | |

## CPU considerations

n8n isn't CPU intensive so even small instances (of providers such as AWS and GCP) should be enough for most use cases. Usually, memory requirements supersede CPU requirements, so focus resources there when planning your infrastructure.

## Database considerations

n8n uses its database to store credentials, past executions, and workflows.

A core feature of n8n is the flexibility to choose a database. All the supported databases have different advantages and disadvantages, which you have to consider individually and pick the one that best suits your needs. By default n8n creates an SQLite database if no database exists at the given location.

n8n recommends that every n8n instance have a dedicated database. This helps to prevent dependencies and potential performance degradation. If it isn't possible to provide a dedicated database for every n8n instance, n8n recommends making use of Postgres's schema feature.

For Postgres, the database must already exist on the DB-instance. The database user for the n8n process needs to have full permissions on all tables that they're using or creating. n8n creates and maintains the database schema.

### Best practices

* SSD storage.
* In containerized cloud environments, ensure that the volume is persisted and mounted when stopping/starting a container. If not, all data is lost.
* If using Postgres, don't use the `tablePrefix` configuration option. It will be deprecated in the near future.
* Pay attention to the changelog of new versions and consider reverting migrations before downgrading.
* Set up at least the basic database security and stability mechanisms such as IP allow lists and backups.

## Memory considerations

An n8n instance doesn't typically require large amounts of available memory. For example an n8n Cloud instance at idle requires ~100MB. It's the nature of your workflows and the data being processed that determines your memory requirements.

For example, while most nodes just pass data to the next node in the workflow, the [Code node](/code/code-node/) creates a pre-processing and post-processing copy of the data. When dealing will large binary files, this can consume all available resources."

# White labelling

--8<-- ""_snippets/embed-license.md""

White labelling n8n means customizing the frontend styling and assets to match your brand identity. The process involves changing two packages in n8n's source code [github.com/n8n-io/n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n){:target=_blank .external-link}:

* [packages/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/design-system){:target=_blank .external-link}: n8n's [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} design system with CSS styles and Vue.js components
* [packages/editor-ui](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/editor-ui){:target=_blank .external-link}: n8n's [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} frontend build with [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev){:target=_blank .external-link}

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/prerequisites.md""

Create a fork of [n8n's repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n){:target=_blank .external-link} and clone your new repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/n8n.git n8n
cd n8n
```

Install all dependencies, build and start n8n.

```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Whenever you make changes you need to rebuild and restart n8n. While developing you can use `npm run dev` to automatically rebuild and restart n8n anytime you make code changes. 

## Theme colors

To customize theme colors open [packages/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/design-system){:target=_blank .external-link} and start with:

- [packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.scss){:target=_blank .external-link}
- [packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.dark.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.dark.scss){:target=_blank .external-link}

At the top of `_tokens.scss` you will find `--color-primary` variables as HSL colors:

```scss
@mixin theme {
	--color-primary-h: 6.9;
	--color-primary-s: 100%;
	--color-primary-l: 67.6%;
```

In the following example the primary color changes to <span style=""color:#0099ff"">#0099ff</span>. To convert to HSL you can use a [color converter tool](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp){:target=_blank .external-link}.

```scss
@mixin theme {
	--color-primary-h: 204;
	--color-primary-s: 100%;
	--color-primary-l: 50%;
```

![Example Theme Color Customization](/_images/embed/white-label/color-transition.gif)


## Theme logos

To change the editor’s logo assets look into [packages/editor-ui/public](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/editor-ui/public){:target=_blank .external-link} and replace:

- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon.ico
- n8n-logo.svg
- n8n-logo-collapsed.svg
- n8n-logo-expanded.svg

Replace these logo assets. n8n uses them in Vue.js components, including:

* [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue){:target=_blank .external-link}: top/left logo in the main sidebar.
* [Logo.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/Logo.vue): reused in other components.

In the following example replace `n8n-logo-collapsed.svg` and `n8n-logo-expanded.svg` to update the main sidebar's logo assets.

![Example Logo Main Sidebar](/_images/embed/white-label/logo-main-sidebar.png)

If your logo assets require different sizing or placement you can customize SCSS styles at the bottom of [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue){:target=_blank .external-link}.

```scss
.logoItem {
	display: flex;
	justify-content: space-between;
	height: $header-height;
	line-height: $header-height;
	margin: 0 !important;
	border-radius: 0 !important;
	border-bottom: var(--border-width-base) var(--border-style-base) var(--color-background-xlight);
	cursor: default;

	&:hover, &:global(.is-active):hover {
		background-color: initial !important;
	}

	* { vertical-align: middle; }
	.icon {
		height: 18px;
		position: relative;
		left: 6px;
	}

}
```

## Text localization

To change all text occurrences like `n8n` or `n8n.io` to your brand identity you can customize n8n's English internationalization file: [packages/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json){:target=_blank .external-link}.

n8n uses the [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/){:target=_blank .external-link} internationalization plugin for Vue.js to translate the majority of UI texts. To search and replace text occurrences inside `en.json` you can use [Linked locale messages](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/messages.html#linked-locale-messages){:target=_blank .external-link}.

In the following example add the `_brand.name` translation key to white label n8n's [AboutModal.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/AboutModal.vue){:target=_blank .external-link}.

```js
{
	""_brand.name"": ""My Brand"",
	//replace n8n with link to _brand.name
	""about.aboutN8n"": ""About @:_brand.name"",
	""about.n8nVersion"": ""@:_brand.name Version"",
}
```

![Example About Modal Localization](/_images/embed/white-label/about-modal.png)

### Window title

To change n8n's window title to your brand name, edit the following:

- [packages/editor-ui/index.html](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/index.html){:target=_blank .external-link}
- [packages/editor-ui/src/components/mixins/titleChange.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/mixins/titleChange.ts){:target=_blank .external-link}

The following example replaces all occurrences of `n8n` and `n8n.io` with `My Brand` in `index.html` and `titleChange.ts`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
	<!-- Replace html title attribute -->
	<title>My Brand - Workflow Automation</title>
</head>
```

```typescript
$titleSet(workflow: string, status: WorkflowTitleStatus) {
	// replace n8n prefix
	window.document.title = `My Brand - ${icon} ${workflow}`;
},

$titleReset() {
	// replace n8n prefix
	document.title = `My Brand - Workflow Automation`;
},
```

# Error handling

When designing your flow logic, it's a good practice to consider potential errors, and set up methods to handle them gracefully. With an error workflow, you can control how n8n responds to a workflow execution failure.

/// note | Investigating errors
To investigate failed executions, you can:

* Review your [Executions](/workflows/executions/), for a [single workflow](/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/) or [all workflows you have access to](/workflows/executions/all-executions/). You can [load data from previous execution](/workflows/executions/debug/) into your current workflow.
* Enable [Log streaming](/log-streaming/).
///

## Create and set an error workflow

For each workflow, you can set an error workflow in **Workflow Settings**. It runs if an execution fails. This means you can, for example, send email or Slack alerts when a workflow execution errors. The error workflow must start with the [Error Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/).

You can use the same error workflow for multiple workflows.

--8<-- ""_snippets/flow-logic/create-set-error-workflow.md""

## Error data

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/error-trigger/error-data.md""

## Cause a workflow execution failure using Stop And Error

When you create and set an error workflow, n8n runs it when an execution fails. Usually, this is due to things like errors in node settings, or the workflow running out of memory.

You can add the [Stop And Error](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to your workflow to force executions to fail under your chosen circumstances, and trigger the error workflow."

title: Execution order in multi-branch workflows
description: How n8n decides the node execution order in multi-branch workflows.
contentType: explanation
---

# Execution order in multi-branch workflows

n8n's node execution order depends on the version of n8n you're using:

* For workflows created before version 1.0: n8n executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on.
* For workflows created in version 1.0 and above: executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the canvas, from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.

# Flow logic

n8n allows you to represent complex logic in your workflows.

[[% import ""_macros/section-toc.html"" as sectionToc %]]

This section covers:

[[ sectionToc.sectionToc(page) ]]

## Related sections

You need some understanding of [Data](/data/) in n8n, including [Data structure](/data/data-structure/) and [Data flow within nodes](/data/data-flow-nodes/).

When building your logic, you'll use n8n's [Core nodes](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/), including:

* Splitting: [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) and [Switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/).
* Merging: [Merge](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/), [Compare Datasets](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/), and [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).
* Looping: [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) and [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/).
* Waiting: [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/).
* Creating sub-workflows: [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) and [Execute Workflow Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/).
* Error handling: [Stop And Error](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) and [Error Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/)."

# Looping in n8n

Looping is useful when you want to process multiple items or perform an action repeatedly, such as sending a message to every contact in your address book. n8n handles this repetitive processing automatically, meaning you don't need to specifically build loops into your workflows. There are [some nodes](#node-exceptions) where this isn't true.

## Using loops in n8n

n8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point, or a single row in the output table of a node.

![The Customer Datastore node output](/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png)

Nodes usually run once for each item. For example, if you wanted to send the name and notes of the customers in the Customer Datastore node as a message on Slack, you would:

1. Connect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node.
2. Configure the parameters.
3. Execute the node. 

You would receive five messages: one for each item.

This is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop.

### Executing nodes once

For situations where you don't want a node to process all received items, for example sending a Slack message only to the first customer, you can do so by toggling the **Execute Once** parameter in the **Settings** tab of that node This setting is helpful when the incoming data contains multiple items and you want to only process the first one. 


## Creating loops

n8n typically handles the iteration for all incoming items. However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. Refer to [Node exceptions](#node-exceptions) for a list of nodes that don't automatically iterate over all incoming items.

### Loop until a condition is met

To create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Add an [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check when to stop the loop. 

Here is an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1130) that implements a loop with an `IF` node:

![Editor UI view of sample workflow](/_images/flow-logic/looping/example_workflow.png)

### Loop until all items are processed

Use the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node when you want to loop until all items are processed. To process each item individually, set **Batch Size** to `1`.

You can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items.

The Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop.

## Node exceptions

Nodes and operations where you need to design a loop into your workflow:

* [CrateDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cratedb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
* [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode: processes all the items based on the entered code snippet.
* [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode.
* [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): you must handle pagination yourself. If your API call returns paginated results you must create a loop to fetch one page at a time.
* [Microsoft SQL](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/) executes once for `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.
* [MongoDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mongodb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
* [QuestDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.questdb/) executes once for `insert`.
* [Redis](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redis/):
	* Info: this operation executes only once, regardless of the number of items in the incoming data.
* [TimescaleDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`."

# Merging data

Merging brings multiple data streams together. You can achieve this using different nodes depending on your workflow requirements.

- Merge data from different data streams or nodes: Use the [Merge](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) node to combine data from various sources into one.
- Merge data from multiple node executions: Use the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node for complex scenarios where you need to merge data from multiple executions of a node or multiple nodes. 
- Compare and merge data: Use the [Compare Datasets](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node to compare, merge, and output data streams based on the comparison.

Explore each method in more detail in the sections below.

## Merge data from different data streams

If your workflow [splits](/flow-logic/splitting/), you combine the separate streams back into one stream.

Here's an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/) showing different types of merging: appending data sets, keeping only new items, and keeping only existing items. The [Merge node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) documentation contains details on each of the merge operations.

[[ workflowDemo(""https://api.n8n.io/workflows/templates/1747"") ]]

## Merge data from different nodes

You can use the Merge node to combine data from two previous nodes, even if the workflow hasn't split into separate data streams. This can be useful if you want to generate a single dataset from the data generated by multiple nodes.

<figure markdown=""span"">
![Merging data from two previous nodes. The diagram shows three nodes lined up sequentially. The first node is labeled Fetch data, the second is labeled Modify data, and the third is labeled Merge: append both data sets. Arrows connect nodes 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 1 to 3.](/_images/flow-logic/merging/merge-node-data.png)
<figcaption>Merging data from two previous nodes</figcaption>
</figure>

## Merge data from multiple node executions

Use the Code node to merge data from multiple node executions. This is useful in some [Looping](/flow-logic/looping/) scenarios.

/// note | Node executions and workflow executions
This section describes merging data from multiple node executions. This is when a node executes multiple times during a single workflow execution. 
///
Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1814-merge-multiple-runs-into-one/){:target=_blank .external-link} using Loop Over Items and Wait to artificially create multiple executions.

[[ workflowDemo(""https://api.n8n.io/workflows/templates/1814"") ]]

## Compare, merge, and split again

The [Compare Datasets](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node compares data streams before merging them. It outputs up to four different data streams.

Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1943-comparing-data-with-the-compare-datasets-node/){:target=_blank .external-link} for an example.

# Splitting workflows with conditional nodes

Splitting uses the [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) nodes. It turns a single-branch workflow into a multi-branch workflow. This is a key piece of representing complex logic in n8n.

Compare these workflows:

![""Diagram representing two workflows. One has three steps and follows a linear process, with a user submitting a bug, and the workflow emailing a support team. The second workflow starts the same way, but then splits depending on whether the user marked the issue as urgent. It then splits again depending on the user's support plan""](/_images/flow-logic/splitting/single-multi-branch-workflow.png)

This is the power of splitting and conditional nodes in n8n.

Refer to the [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) documentation for usage details."

# Sub-workflows

You can call one workflow from another workflow. This allows you to build modular, microservice-like workflows. It can also help if your workflow grows large enough to encounter [memory issues](/hosting/scaling/memory-errors/). Creating sub-workflows uses the [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) and [Execute Workflow Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) nodes.

description: How to make your workflow execution wait.
contentType: howto
---

# Waiting

Waiting allows you to pause a workflow mid-execution, then resume where the workflow left off, with the same data. This is useful if you need to rate limit your calls to a service, or wait for an external event to complete. You can wait for a specified duration, or until a webhook fires.

Making a workflow wait uses the [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node. Refer to the node documentation for usage details.

n8n provides a workflow template with a basic example of [Rate limiting and waiting for external events](https://n8n.io/workflows/1749-rate-limiting-and-waiting-for-external-events/){:target=_blank .external-link}."

# Get help with n8n

If you need more help with n8n, you can ask for support in the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/){:target=_blank class=.external-link}. This is the best source of answers, as both the n8n support team and community members can help.

If your Cloud instance is having issues, or if you're an enterprise customer who needs support, you can contact [help@n8n.io](mailto:help@n8n.io).

## Use the About n8n debug tool

Whether you're posting to the forum or emailing customer support, you'll get help faster if you provide details about your n8n instance in your first post or email.

The fastest way to do this is to use the **About n8n** debug tool:

1. Open the left-side panel.
2. Select **Help**.
3. Select **About n8n**.
4. The **About n8n** modal opens to display your current information.
5. Select **Copy debug information** to copy your information.
6. n8n recommends pasting this information into your forum post or support email.

/// note | Don't see **Copy debug**?
The **Copy debug** option is available beginning in n8n version 1.49.0.

If you're using an earlier version of n8n, n8n recommends manually providing this information:

* n8n version
* Database
* n8n EXECUTIONS_PROCESS setting
* Running n8n via (Docker, npm, n8n cloud)
* Operating system

# CLI commands for n8n

n8n includes a CLI (command line interface), allowing you to perform actions using the CLI rather than the n8n editor. These include starting workflows, and exporting and importing workflows and credentials.

## Running CLI commands

You can use CLI commands with self-hosted n8n. Depending on how you choose to install n8n, there are differences in how to run the commands:

* npm: the `n8n` command is directly available. The documentation uses this in the examples below.
* Docker: the `n8n` command is available within your Docker container:
    ```sh
    docker exec -u node -it <n8n-container-name> <n8n-cli-command>
    ```

## Start a workflow

You can start workflows directly using the CLI.

Execute a saved workflow by its ID:

```bash
n8n execute --id <ID>
```

## Change the active status of a workflow

You can change the active status of a workflow using the CLI.

/// note | Restart required
These commands operate on your n8n database. If you execute them while n8n is running, the changes don't take effect until you restart n8n.
///	

Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to false:

```bash
n8n update:workflow --id=<ID> --active=false
```

Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to true:

```bash
n8n update:workflow --id=<ID> --active=true
```

Set the active status to false for all the workflows:

```bash
n8n update:workflow --all --active=false
```

Set the active status to true for all the workflows:

```bash
n8n update:workflow --all --active=true
```

## Export workflows and credentials

You can export your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.

Command flags:

| Flag | Description |
|-------------|-------|
| --help | Help prompt. |
| --all | Exports all workflows/credentials. |
| --backup | Sets --all --pretty --separate for backups. You can optionally set --output. |
| --id | The ID of the workflow to export. |
| --output | Outputs file name or directory if using separate files. |
| --pretty | Formats the output in an easier to read fashion. |
| --separate | Exports one file per workflow (useful for versioning). Must set a directory using --output. |
| --decrypted | Exports the credentials in a plain text format. |

### Workflows

Export all your workflows to the standard output (terminal):

```bash
n8n export:workflow --all
```

Export a workflow by its ID and specify the output file name:

```bash
n8n export:workflow --id=<ID> --output=file.json
```

Export all workflows to a specific directory in a single file:

```bash
n8n export:workflow --all --output=backups/latest/file.json
```

Export all the workflows to a specific directory using the `--backup` flag (details above):

```bash
n8n export:workflow --backup --output=backups/latest/
```

### Credentials

Export all your credentials to the standard output (terminal):

```bash
n8n export:credentials --all
```

Export credentials by their ID and specify the output file name:

```bash
n8n export:credentials --id=<ID> --output=file.json
```

Export all credentials to a specific directory in a single file:

```bash
n8n export:credentials --all --output=backups/latest/file.json
```

Export all the credentials to a specific directory using the `--backup` flag (details above):

```bash
n8n export:credentials --backup --output=backups/latest/
```

Export all the credentials in plain text format. You can use this to migrate from one installation to another that has a different secret key in the configuration file.

/// warning | Sensitive information
All sensitive information is visible in the files.
///
```bash
n8n export:credentials --all --decrypted --output=backups/decrypted.json
```


## Import workflows and credentials

You can import your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.

/// warning | Update the IDs
When exporting workflows and credentials, n8n also exports their IDs. If you have workflows and credentials with the same IDs in your existing database, they will be overwritten. To avoid this, delete or change the IDs before importing.
///

Available flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| --help | Help prompt. |
| --input | Input file name or directory if you use --separate. |
| --projectId | Import the workflow or credential to the specified project. Can't be used with `--userId`. |
| --separate | Imports `*.json` files from directory provided by --input. |
| --userId | Import the workflow or credential to the specified user. Can't be used with `--projectId`. |

/// note | Migrating to SQLite
n8n limits workflow and credential names to 128 characters, but SQLite doesn't enforce size limits.

This might result in errors like **Data too long for column name** during the import process.

In this case, you can edit the names from the n8n interface and export again, or edit the JSON file directly before importing.
///




### Workflows

Import workflows from a specific file:

```bash
n8n import:workflow --input=file.json
```
Import all the workflow files as JSON from the specified directory:

```bash
n8n import:workflow --separate --input=backups/latest/
```

### Credentials

Import credentials from a specific file:

```bash
n8n import:credentials --input=file.json
```

Import all the credentials files as JSON from the specified directory:

```bash
n8n import:credentials --separate --input=backups/latest/
```

## License

### Clear

Clear your existing license from n8n's database and reset n8n to default features:

```sh
n8n license:clear
```

### Info

Display information about the existing license:

```sh
n8n license:info
```

## User management

You can reset user management using the n8n CLI. This returns user management to its pre-setup state. It removes all user accounts.

Use this if you forget your password, and don't have SMTP set up to do password resets by email.

```sh
n8n user-management:reset
```

### Disable MFA for a user

If a user loses their recovery codes you can disable MFA for a user with this command. The user will then be able to log back in to set up MFA again.

```sh
n8n mfa:disable --email=johndoe@example.com
```

### Disable LDAP

You can reset the LDAP settings using the command below.

```sh
n8n ldap:reset
```

## Security audit

You can run a [security audit](/hosting/logging-monitoring/security-audit/) on your n8n instance, to detect common security issues.

```sh
n8n audit
```"

description: Understand the n8n database structure
contentType: explanation

# Database structure

This page describes the purpose of each table in the n8n database.

## Database and query technology

By default, n8n uses SQLite as the database. If you are using another database the structure will be similar, but the data-types may be different depending on the database.

n8n uses [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm){:target=_blank .external-link} for queries and migrations.

To inspect the n8n database, you can use [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io){:target=_blank .external-link}, which is an open-source universal database tool.

## Tables

These are the tables n8n creates during setup.
<!-- vale off -->
### auth_identity

Stores details of external authentication providers when using [SAML](/user-management/saml/).

### auth_provider_sync_history

Stores the history of a SAML connection.

### credentials_entity

Stores the credentials used to authenticate with integrations.

### event_destinations

Contains the destination configurations for [Log streaming](/log-streaming/).

### execution_data

Contains the workflow at time of running, and the execution data.

### execution_entity

Stores all saved workflow executions. Workflow settings can affect which executions n8n saves.

### execution_metadata

Stores [Custom executions data](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).

### installed_nodes

Lists the [community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) installed in your n8n instance.

### installed_packages

Details of npm community nodes packages installed in your n8n instance. [installed_nodes](#installed_nodes) lists each individual node. `installed_packages` lists npm packages, which may contain more than one node.

### migrations

# Architecture

Understanding n8n's underlying architecture is helpful if you need to:

* Embed n8n
* Customize n8n's default databases

This section is a work in progress. If you have questions, please try the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/){:target=_blank .external-link} and let n8n know which architecture documents would be useful for you."

title: Configuration methods
description: How to set environment variables for n8n.
contentType: howto
---

# Configuration

You can change n8n's settings using environment variables. For a full list of available configurations see [Environment Variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).

## Set environment variables by command line

### npm

For npm, set your desired environment variables in terminal using the `export` command as shown below:

```bash
export <variable>=<value>
```

### Docker

In Docker you can use the `-e` flag from the command line:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=""false"" \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

## Set environment variables using a file

You can also configure n8n using a configuration file.

Only define the values that need to be different from the default in your configuration file. You can use multiple files. For example, you can have a file with generic base settings, and files with specific values for different environments.

### npm

Set the path to the JSON configuration file using the environment variable `N8N_CONFIG_FILES`:

```shell
# Bash - Single file
export N8N_CONFIG_FILES=/<path-to-config>/my-config.json
# Bash - Multiple files are comma-separated
export N8N_CONFIG_FILES=/<path-to-config>/my-config.json,/<path-to-config>/production.json

# PowerShell - Single file, persist for current user
# Note that setting scope (Process, User, Machine) has no effect on Unix systems
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('N8N_CONFIG_FILES', '<path-to-config>\config.json', 'User')
```

Example file:

```json
{
 ""executions"": {
  ""saveDataOnSuccess"": ""none""
 },
 ""generic"": {
  ""timezone"": ""Europe/Berlin""
 },
 ""nodes"": {
  ""exclude"": ""[\""n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\"",\""n8n-nodes-base.writeBinaryFile\""]""
 }
}
```

/// note | Formatting as JSON
You can't always work out the correct JSON from the [Environment variables reference](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/). For example, to set `N8N_METRICS` to `true`, you need to do:

```json
{
	""endpoints"": {
		""metrics"": {
			""enable"": true
		}
	}
}
```

Refer to the [Schema file in the source code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/config/schema.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} for full details of the expected settings.
///


### Docker

In Docker, you can set your environment variables in the `n8n: environment:` element of your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

For example:

```yaml
n8n:
    environment:
      - N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false
```

### Keeping sensitive data in separate files

You can append `_FILE` to individual environment variables to provide their configuration in a separate file, enabling you to avoid passing sensitive details using environment variables. n8n loads the data from the file with the given name, making it possible to load data from [Docker-Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Kubernetes-Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/){:target=_blank .external-link}. 

Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for details on each variable.

While most environment variables can use the `_FILE` suffix, it's more beneficial for sensitive data such as credentials and database configuration. Here are some examples: 

```yaml
CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA_FILE=/path/to/credentials_data
DB_TYPE_FILE=/path/to/db_type
DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE_FILE=/path/to/database_name
DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST_FILE=/path/to/database_host
DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT_FILE=/path/to/database_port
DB_POSTGRESDB_USER_FILE=/path/to/database_user
DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD_FILE=/path/to/database_password
DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA_FILE=/path/to/database_schema
DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA_FILE=/path/to/ssl_ca
DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/ssl_cert
DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_KEY_FILE=/path/to/ssl_key
DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED_FILE=/path/to/ssl_reject_unauth
```"

# Supported databases

By default, n8n uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions, and workflows. n8n also supports PostgresDB.

## Shared settings

The following environment variables get used by all databases:

 - `DB_TABLE_PREFIX` (default: -) - Prefix for table names

## PostgresDB

To use PostgresDB as the database, you can provide the following environment variables:

 - `DB_TYPE=postgresdb`
 - `DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE` (default: 'n8n')
 - `DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST` (default: 'localhost')
 - `DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT` (default: 5432)
 - `DB_POSTGRESDB_USER` (default: 'postgres')
 - `DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD` (default: empty)
 - `DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA` (default: 'public')
 - `DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA` (default: undefined): Path to the server's CA certificate used to validate the connection (opportunistic encryption isn't supported)
 - `DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CERT` (default: undefined): Path to the client's TLS certificate
 - `DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_KEY` (default: undefined): Path to the client's private key corresponding to the certificate
 - `DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` (default: true): If TLS connections that fail validation should be rejected

```bash
export DB_TYPE=postgresdb
export DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=n8n
export DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=postgresdb
export DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=5432
export DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=n8n
export DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=n8n
export DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=n8n

# optional:
export DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA=$(pwd)/ca.crt
export DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false

n8n start
```

### Required permissions

n8n needs to create and modify the schemas of the tables it uses.

Recommended permissions:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE n8n-db;
CREATE USER n8n-user WITH PASSWORD 'random-password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE n8n-db TO n8n-user;
```

### TLS

You can choose between these configurations:

- Not declaring (default): Connect with `SSL=off`
- Declaring only the CA and unauthorized flag: Connect with `SSL=on` and verify the server's signature
- Declaring `_{CERT,KEY}` and the above: Use the certificate and key for client TLS authentication

## SQLite

This is the default database that gets used if nothing is defined.

The database file is located at:
`~/.n8n/database.sqlite`"

title: Task runners
description: How to configure task runners to execute tasks using internal or external runner processes.
contentType: howto
---

# Task runners

Task runners are a generic mechanism to execute tasks in a secure and performant way. They're used to execute user-provided JavaScript code in the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

This document describes how task runners work and how you can configure them.

/// note | Experimental feature
Task runners are currently in public beta testing and might contain undiscovered issues. We don't recommend using them with business critical workflows.
///

## How it works

The task runner feature consists of three components: a task runner, a task broker, and a task requester.

![Task runner overview](/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-concept.png)

Task runners connect to the task broker using a websocket connection. A task requester submits a task request to the broker where an available task runner can pick it up for execution.

The runner executes the task and submits the results to the task requester. The task broker coordinates communication between the runner and the requester.

The n8n instance (main and worker) acts as the broker. The Code node in this case is the task requester.

## Task runner modes

You can use task runners in two different modes: internal and external.

### Internal mode

In internal mode, the n8n instance launches the task runner as a child process. The n8n process monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner. The task runner process shares the same `uid` and `gid` as n8n.

### External mode

In external mode, an external orchestrator (for example, Kubernetes) launches the task runner instead of n8n. Typically, this means you would configure the task runner to run as a side-car container next to n8n.

![Task runner deployed as a side-car container](/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-external-mode.png)

In this mode, the orchestrator monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner container. The task runner is fully isolated from the n8n instance.

When using the [Queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode), each n8n container (main and workers) needs to have its own task runner.

## Setting up external mode

Use the following details to configure task runners in external mode

### Configuring n8n instance in external mode

You can configure n8n to use external task runners by setting the following environment variables:

| Environment variables                                  | Description                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true`                             | Enables task runners.                                      |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_MODE=external`                            | Use task runners in external mode.                         |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>` | A shared secret task runners use to connect to the broker. |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_SERVER_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` | By default, the task broker only listens to localhost. When using multiple containers (for example, with Docker Compose), it needs to be able to accept external connections. |

For full list of environment variables see [task runner environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/).

### Configuring task runners in external mode

The task runner comes bundled within the n8n Docker image. The Docker image also includes the task runner launcher.

The launcher can start the runner on-demand, which means lower memory usage when there's no work needed, but a short delay (few hundred ms) in cold-start. The launcher also monitors the runner and restarts it in case of infinite loops or other issues.

Run a task runner container from the n8n Docker image by setting the following properties:

| Configuration   | Description                                             |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `command`       | `[""/usr/local/bin/task-runner-launcher"", ""javascript""]` |
| `livenessProbe` | `GET /healthz`, port `5680`                             |

Set the following environment variables for the container, adjusted to fit your needs:

| Environment variables | Description |
| ------ | ----- |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>` | The shared secret the task runner uses to connect to the broker. |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_MAX_CONCURRENCY=5` | The number of concurrent tasks the runner can execute. |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_TASK_BROKER_URI=localhost:5679` | The address of the task broker server within the n8n instance. |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTO_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=15` | Number of seconds of inactivity to wait before shutting down the task runner process. The launcher will automatically start the runner again when there are new tasks to execute. Set to `0` to disable automatic shutdown. |
| `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=<limit>` | The memory limit for the task runner Node.js process. This should be lower than the limit for container so that the runner runs out of memory before the container. That way, the launcher is able to monitor the runner. |
| `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` | The [same default timezone as configured for the n8n instance](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/). |

For full list of environment variables see [task runner environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/)."

# Configure self-hosted n8n for user management

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance. 

This document describes how to configure your n8n instance to support user management, and the steps to start inviting users.

Refer to the main [User management](/user-management/) guide for more information about usage, including:

* [Managing users](/user-management/manage-users/)
* [Account types](/user-management/account-types/)
* [Best practices](/user-management/best-practices/)

For LDAP setup information, refer to [LDAP](/user-management/ldap/).

For SAML setup information, refer to [SAML](/user-management/saml/).

/// note | Basic auth and JWT removed
n8n removed support for basic auth and JWT in version 1.0.
///
## Setup

There are three stages to set up user management in n8n:

1. Configure your n8n instance to use your SMTP server.
2. Start n8n and follow the setup steps in the app.
3. Invite users.

### Step one: SMTP

n8n recommends setting up an SMTP server, for user invites and password resets. 

/// note | Optional from 0.210.1
From version 0.210.1 onward, this step is optional. You can choose to manually copy and send invite links instead of setting up SMTP. Note that if you skip this step, users can't reset passwords.
///
Get the following information from your SMTP provider:

* Server name
* SMTP username
* SMTP password
* SMTP sender name

To set up SMTP with n8n, configure the SMTP environment variables for your n8n instance. For information on how to set environment variables, refer to [Configuration](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/)

# Configure n8n to use your own certificate authority or self-signed certificate

You can add your own certificate authority (CA) or self-signed certificate to n8n. This means you are able to trust a certain SSL certificate instead of trusting all invalid certificates, which is a potential security risk.

/// note | Available in version 1.42.0
This feature is only available in version 1.42.0+.
///

To use this feature you need to place your certificates in a folder and mount the folder to `/opt/custom-certificates` in the container.

## Docker

The examples below assume you have a folder called `pki` that contains your certificates in either the directory you run the command from or next to your docker compose file.

### Docker CLI
When using the CLI you can use the `-v` flag from the command line:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -v ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
name: n8n
services:
    n8n:
        volumes:
            - ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates
        container_name: n8n
        ports:
            - 5678:5678
        image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

You should also give the right permissions to the imported certs. You can do this once the container is running (assuming n8n as the container name):

```bash
docker exec --user 0 n8n chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/custom-certificates

contentType: howto
---

# Set a custom encryption key

n8n creates a random encryption key automatically on the first launch and saves
it in the `~/.n8n` folder. n8n uses that key to encrypt the credentials before
they get saved to the database. If the key isn't yet in the settings file,
you can set it using an environment variable, so that n8n 
uses your custom key instead of generating a new one.

In [queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/), you must specify the encryption key environment variable for all workers.

```bash
export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<SOME RANDOM STRING>
```

description: Set execution timeouts to determine how long workflows can run.  
contentType: howto

# Configure workflow timeout settings

A workflow times out and gets canceled after this time (in seconds). If the workflow runs in the main process, a soft timeout happens (takes effect after the current node finishes). If a workflow runs in its own process, n8n attempts a soft timeout first, then kills the process after waiting for a fifth of the given timeout duration.

`EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` default is `-1`. For example, if you want to set the timeout to one hour:

```bash
export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT=3600
```

You can also set maximum execution time (in seconds) for each workflow individually. For example, if you want to set maximum execution time to two hours:

```bash
export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX=7200
```

# Isolate n8n

By default, a self-hosted n8n instance sends data to n8n's servers. It notifies users about available updates, workflow templates, and diagnostics. 

To prevent your n8n instance from connecting to n8n's servers, set these environment variables to false: 

```
N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false
N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false

# Enable modules in Code node

For security reasons, the Code node restricts importing modules. It's possible to lift that restriction for built-in and external modules by setting the following environment variables:

- `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN`: For built-in modules
- `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL`: For external modules sourced from n8n/node_modules directory. External module support is disabled when an environment variable isn't set.

```bash
# Allows usage of all builtin modules
export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN=*

# Allows usage of only crypto
export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN=crypto

# Allows usage of only crypto and fs
export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN=crypto,fs

# Enable Prometheus metrics 

To collect and expose metrics, n8n uses the [prom-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prom-client){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} library.

The `/metrics` endpoint is disabled by default, but it's possible to enable it using the `N8N_METRICS` environment variable.

```bash
export N8N_METRICS=true
```

Refer to the respective [Environment Variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/) (`N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_*`) for configuring which metrics and labels should get exposed.

Both `main` and `worker` instances are able to expose metrics.

## Queue metrics

To enable queue metrics, set the `N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_QUEUE_METRICS` env var to `true`. You can adjust the refresh rate with `N8N_METRICS_QUEUE_METRICS_INTERVAL`.

Queue metrics are only available for the `main` instance in single-main mode.

# Configure n8n webhooks with reverse proxy

n8n creates the webhook URL by combining `N8N_PROTOCOL`, `N8N_HOST` and `N8N_PORT`. If n8n runs behind a reverse proxy, that won't work. That's because n8n runs internally on port 5678 but the reverse proxy exposes it to the web on port 443. In that case, it's important to set the webhook URL manually so that n8n can display it in the Editor UI and register the correct webhook URLs with external services.

```bash
export WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.example.com/
```

## Starting n8n

From your terminal, run:

```sh
docker volume create n8n_data

docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

This command will download all required n8n images and start your container, exposed on port `5678`. To save your work between container restarts, it also mounts a docker volume, `n8n_data`, to persist your data locally.

You can then access n8n by opening:
[http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

## Using alternate databases

By default n8n uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions and workflows. n8n also supports PostgresDB configurable using environment variables as detailed below.

It's important to still persist data in the `/home/node/.n8n` folder as it contains n8n user data and even more importantly the encryption key for credentials. It's also the name of the webhook when the n8n tunnel is used.

If no directory is found, n8n creates automatically one on
startup. In this case, existing credentials saved with a different encryption key can not be used anymore.

/// note | Keep in mind
Persisting the `/home/node/.n8n` directory even when using alternate databases is the recommended best practice, but not explicitly required. The encryption key can be provided using the `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).
///
### PostgresDB

To use n8n with Postgres, provide the corresponding:

```sh
docker volume create n8n_data

docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=<POSTGRES_PORT> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=<POSTGRES_SCHEMA> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \
 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

A complete `docker-compose` file for Postgres can be found [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting/tree/main/docker-compose/withPostgres).

## Setting timezone

To define the timezone n8n should use, the environment variable `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` can be set. This gets used by schedule based nodes such as the Cron node.

The timezone of the system can also be set separately. This controls what
some scripts and commands return like `$ date`. The system timezone can be set using the environment variable `TZ`.

Example using the same timezone for both:

```sh
docker volume create n8n_data

docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE=""Europe/Berlin"" \
 -e TZ=""Europe/Berlin"" \
 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

## Updating

From your Docker Desktop, navigate to the **Images** tab and select **Pull** from the context menu to download the latest n8n image:

![Docker Desktop](/_images/hosting/installation/docker/docker_desktop.png)

You can also use the command line to pull the latest, or a specific version:

```sh
# Pull latest (stable) version
docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

# Pull specific version
docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:0.220.1

# Pull next (unstable) version
docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:next
```

Stop the container and start it again. You can also use the command line:

```sh
# Get the container ID
docker ps -a

# Stop the container with ID container_id
docker stop [container_id]

# Remove the container with ID container_id
docker rm [container_id]

# Start the container
docker run --name=[container_name] [options] -d docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

### Docker Compose

# npm

npm is a quick way to get started with n8n on your local machine. You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){:target=_blank .external-link} installed. n8n requires Node.js 18 or above.

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md""

## Try n8n with npx

You can try n8n without installing it using npx.

From the terminal, run:

```bash
npx n8n
```

This command will download everything that's needed to start n8n. You can then access n8n and start building workflows by opening [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Install globally with npm

To install n8n globally, use npm:

```bash
npm install n8n -g
```

To install or update to a specific version of n8n use the `@` syntax to specify the version. For example:

```bash
npm install -g n8n@0.126.1
```

To install `next`:

```bash
npm install -g n8n@next
```

After the installation, start n8n by running:

```bash
n8n
# or
n8n start
```

/// note | Keep in mind
Windows users remember to change into the `.n8n` directory of your Home folder (`~/.n8n`) before running `n8n start`.
///
### Next steps

Try out n8n using the [Quickstarts](/try-it-out/).

## Updating

To update your n8n instance to the `latest` version, run:

```bash
npm update -g n8n
```

To install the `next` version:

```bash
npm install -g n8n@next
```

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/tunnel.md""

Start n8n with `--tunnel` by running:

```bash
n8n start --tunnel
```

## Reverting an upgrade

Install the older version that you want to go back to.

If the upgrade involved a database migration:

1. Check the feature documentation and release notes to see if there are any manual changes you need to make.
1. Run `n8n db:revert` on your current version to roll back the database. If you want to revert more than one database migration, you need to repeat this process.

## Windows troubleshooting

If you are experiencing issues running n8n on Windows, make sure your Node.js environment is correctly set up. Follow Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows){:target=_blank .external-link}."

# Hosting n8n on Amazon Web Services

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

## Hosting options

AWS offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including EC2 (virtual machines), and EKS (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/){:target=_blank .external-link} as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

## Prerequisites

The steps in this guide use a mix of the AWS UI and [the eksctl CLI tool for EKS](https://eksctl.io){:target=_blank .external-link}.

While not mentioned in the documentation for eksctl, you also need to [install the AWS CLI tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html){:target=_blank .external-link}, and [configure authentication of the tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html){:target=_blank .external-link}.

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md""

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md""

## Create a cluster

Use the eksctl tool to create a cluster specifying a name and a region with the following command:

```shell
eksctl create cluster --name n8n --region <your-aws-region>
```

This can take a while to create the cluster.


Once the cluster is created, eksctl automatically sets the kubectl context to the cluster.

## Clone configuration repository

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/aws){:target=_blank .external-link}. The following steps tell you what each file does, and what settings you need to change.

Clone the repository with the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b aws
```

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

```shell
cd n8n-kubernetes-hosting
```

## Configure Postgres

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Configure volume for persistent storage

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default AWS storage class, [gp2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/general-purpose.html#EBSVolumeTypes_gp2){:target=_blank .external-link}, is suitable for this purpose. This is defined in the `postgres-claaim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.

```yaml
…
spec:
  storageClassName: gp2
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
…
```

### Postgres environment variables

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own for user details and the database to use.

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n

### Create a volume for file storage

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes helps maintain files uploaded while using n8n and if you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts, which saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

```yaml
…
volumes:
  - name: n8n-claim0
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: n8n-claim0
…
```

### Pod resources

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/){:target=_blank .external-link} lets you specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:

```yaml
…
resources:
  requests:
    memory: ""250Mi""
  limits:
    memory: ""500Mi""
…    
```

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/suggested-pod-resources.md""

### Optional: Environment variables

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
- Define the container image to use
- Set resource consumption limits
- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

## Services

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively by default.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster

Send all the manifests to the cluster by running the following command in the `n8n-kubernetes-hosting` directory:

```shell
kubectl apply -f .
```

/// note | Namespace error
You may see an error message about not finding an ""n8n"" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```
///


## Set up DNS

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to a static address of the instance.

To find the address of the n8n service running on the instance:

1. Open the **Clusters** section of the **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service** page in the AWS console.
2. Select the name of the cluster to open its configuration page.
3. Select the **Resources** tab, then **Service and networking** > **Services**.
4. Select the **n8n** service and copy the **Load balancer URLs** value. Use this value suffixed with the n8n service port (5678) for DNS.

/// note | Use HTTP
This guide uses HTTP connections for the services it defines, for example in `n8n-deployment.yaml`. However, if you click the **Load balancer URLs** value, EKS takes you to an ""HTTPS"" URL which results in an error. To solve this, when you open the n8n subdomain, make sure to use HTTP.
///
## Delete resources

If you need to delete the setup, you can remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

```shell
kubectl delete -f .
```

# Hosting n8n on Azure

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Azure. It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites

You need [The Azure command line tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md""

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md""

## Hosting options

Azure offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including Azure Container Instances (optimized for running containers), Linux Virtual Machines, and Azure Kubernetes Service (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

The steps in this guide use a mix of the Azure UI and command line tool, but you can use either to accomplish most tasks.

## Open the Azure Kubernetes Service

From [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} select **Kubernetes services**.

## Create a cluster

From the Kubernetes services page, select **Create** > **Create a Kubernetes cluster**.

You can select any of the configuration options that suit your needs, then select **Create** when done.

## Set Kubectl context

The remainder of the steps in this guide require you to set the Azure instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and then the **Connect** button. The resulting code snippets shows the steps to paste and run into a terminal to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new cluster.

## Clone configuration repository

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/azure){:target=_blank .external-link}. The following steps tell you which file configures what and what you need to change.

Clone the repository with the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b azure
```

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

```shell
cd azure
```

## Configure Postgres

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Configure volume for persistent storage

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default storage class is suitable for this purpose and is defined in the `postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.

/// note | Specialized storage classes
If you have specialised or higher requirements for storage classes, [read more on the options Azure offers in the documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-storage#storage-classes){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}.
///
### Postgres environment variables

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n

### Create a volume for file storage

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:

* Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
* If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

```yaml
…
volumes:
  - name: n8n-claim0
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: n8n-claim0
…
```

### Pod resources

[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:

```yaml
…
resources:
  requests:
    memory: ""250Mi""
  limits:
    memory: ""500Mi""
…    
```

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/suggested-pod-resources.md""

### Optional: Environment variables

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
- Define the container image to use
- Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object
- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

## Services

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.

## Set up DNS

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & ingresses** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **External IP** column. You need to add the n8n port, ""5678"" to the URL.

/// note | Static IP addresses with AKS

# Hosting n8n on DigitalOcean

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on a DigitalOcean droplet. It uses:

* [Caddy](http://caddyserver.com){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Droplet from the internet. Caddy will also automatically create and manage SSL / TLS certificates for your n8n instance.
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} to create and define the application components and how they work together.

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md""

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md""

## Create a Droplet

1. [Log in](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login){:target=_blank .external-link} to DigitalOcean. 
2. Select the project to host the Droplet, or [create a new project](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/projects/how-to/create/){:target=_blank .external-link}.
3. In your project, select **Droplets** from the **Manage** menu. 
4. [Create a new Droplet](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/create/){:target=_blank .external-link} using the [Docker image](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/docker){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} available on the **Marketplace** tab.

/// note | Droplet resources
When creating the Droplet, DigitalOcean asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, a basic shared CPU plan is enough.
///
/// note | SSH key or Password
DigitalOcean lets you choose between SSH key and password-based authentication. SSH keys are considered more secure.
///
## Log in to your Droplet and create new user

The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the Droplet using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [How to Connect to Droplets with SSH](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} for more information.

You should create a new user, to avoid working as the root user:

1. Log in as root.
2. Create a new user:
	```shell
	adduser <username>
	```
3. Follow the prompts in the CLI to finish creating the user.
4. Grant the new user administrative privileges:
	```shell
	usermod -aG sudo <username>
	```
	You can now run commands with superuser privileges by using `sudo` before the command.
5. Follow the steps to set up SSH for the new user: [Add Public Key Authentication](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04#step-four-add-public-key-authentication-recommended){:target=_blank .external-link}.
5. Log out of the droplet.
6. Log in using SSH as the new user.

## Clone configuration repository

Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy){:target=_blank .external-link} into the home folder of the logged-in user on your Droplet. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.

Clone the repository with the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git
```

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

```shell
cd n8n-docker-caddy
```

## Default folders and files

The host operating system (the DigitalOcean Droplet) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:

- `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.
- `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.

### Create Docker volumes

To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} that Docker reuses between restarts:

```shell
sudo docker volume create caddy_data
```

Create a Docker volume for the n8n data:

```shell
sudo docker volume create n8n_data
```

## Set up DNS

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the Droplet. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new ""A"" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}.

## Open ports

n8n runs as a web application, so the Droplet needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.

Open the following ports in the Droplet's firewall by running the following two commands:

```shell
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
```

## Configure n8n

n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.

Open the file with the following command:

```shell
nano .env
```

The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.

Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## The Docker Compose file

The Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.

- The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.
- The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.

The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:

```shell
nano docker-compose.yml
```

## Configure Caddy

Caddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.

```shell
nano caddy_config/Caddyfile
```

Change the placeholder domain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```text
n8n.<domain>.<suffix> {
    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
      flush_interval -1
    }
}
```

If you were to use `automate.example.com`, your `Caddyfile` may look something like:

```text
automate.example.com {
    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
      flush_interval -1
    }
}
```

## Start Docker Compose

Start n8n and Caddy with the following command:

```shell
sudo docker compose up -d
```

This may take a few minutes.

## Test your setup

In your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.

## Stop n8n and Caddy

You can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:

```shell
sudo docker compose stop
```

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md""

### 1. Install Docker

This can vary depending on the Linux distribution used. You can find detailed instructions in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/){:target=_blank .external-link}. The following example is for Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo ""deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

### 2. Optional: Non-root user access

Run when logged in as the user that should also be allowed to run docker:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
su - ${USER}
```

### 3. Install Docker-Compose

This can vary depending on the Linux distribution used. You can find detailed instructions in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

The example below is for Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
```

### 4. DNS setup

Add A record to route the subdomain accordingly:

```
Type: A
Name: n8n (or the desired subdomain)
IP address: <IP_OF_YOUR_SERVER>
```

### 5. Create Docker Compose file

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file. Paste the following in the file:

```yaml
version: ""3.7""

services:
  traefik:
    image: ""traefik""
    restart: always
    command:
      - ""--api=true""
      - ""--api.insecure=true""
      - ""--providers.docker=true""
      - ""--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false""
      - ""--entrypoints.web.address=:80""
      - ""--entrypoints.web.http.redirections.entryPoint.to=websecure""
      - ""--entrypoints.web.http.redirections.entrypoint.scheme=https""
      - ""--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443""
      - ""--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.tlschallenge=true""
      - ""--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.email=${SSL_EMAIL}""
      - ""--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json""
    ports:
      - ""80:80""
      - ""443:443""
    volumes:
      - traefik_data:/letsencrypt
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro

  n8n:
    image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
    restart: always
    ports:
      - ""127.0.0.1:5678:5678""
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.rule=Host(`${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}`)
      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.tls=true
      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.entrypoints=web,websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.tls.certresolver=mytlschallenge
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.SSLRedirect=true
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSSeconds=315360000
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.browserXSSFilter=true
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.contentTypeNosniff=true
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.forceSTSHeader=true
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.SSLHost=${DOMAIN_NAME}
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSIncludeSubdomains=true
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSPreload=true
      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.middlewares=n8n@docker
    environment:
      - N8N_HOST=${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}
      - N8N_PORT=5678
      - N8N_PROTOCOL=https
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - WEBHOOK_URL=https://${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}/
      - GENERIC_TIMEZONE=${GENERIC_TIMEZONE}
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n

volumes:
  traefik_data:
    external: true
  n8n_data:
    external: true
```

If you are planning on reading/writing local files with n8n (for example, by using the [Read/Write Files from Disk node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/), you will need to configure a data directory for those files here. If you are running n8n as a root user, add this under `volumes` for the n8n service:

```yaml
- /local-files:/files
```

If you are running n8n as a non-root user, add this under `volumes` for the n8n service:

```yaml
- /home/<YOUR USERNAME>/n8n-local-files:/files
```

You will now be able to write files to the `/files` directory in n8n and they will appear on your server in either `/local-files` or `/home/<YOUR USERNAME>/n8n-local-files`, respectively.

### 6. Create `.env` file

Create an `.env` file and change it accordingly.

```bash
# The top level domain to serve from
DOMAIN_NAME=example.com

# The subdomain to serve from
SUBDOMAIN=n8n

# DOMAIN_NAME and SUBDOMAIN combined decide where n8n will be reachable from
# above example would result in: https://n8n.example.com

# Optional timezone to set which gets used by Cron-Node by default
# If not set New York time will be used
GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin

# The email address to use for the SSL certificate creation
SSL_EMAIL=user@example.com
```

### 7. Create data folder

Create the Docker volume that's defined as `n8n_data`. n8n will save the database file from SQLite and the encryption key in this volume.

```sh
sudo docker volume create n8n_data
```

Create a volume for the Traefik data, This is defined as `traefik_data`.


```sh
sudo docker volume create traefik_data
```

### 8. Start Docker Compose

n8n can now be started via:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

To stop the container:

```bash
sudo docker compose stop
```

### 9. Done

n8n will now be reachable using the above defined subdomain + domain combination.
The above example would result in: `https://n8n.example.com`

n8n will only be reachable using `https` and not using `http`.

# Hosting n8n on Google Cloud

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Google Cloud (GCP). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites

- The [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}
- The [gke-gcloud-auth-plugin](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} (install the gcloud CLI first)

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md""

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md""

## Hosting options

Google Cloud offers several options suitable for hosting n8n, including Cloud Run (optimized for running containers), Compute Engine (VMs), and Kubernetes Engine (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

Most of the steps in this guide use the Google Cloud UI, but you can also use the [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} instead to undertake all the steps.

## Create project

GCP encourages you to create projects to logically organize resources and configuration. Create a new project for your n8n deployment from your Google Cloud Console: select the project dropdown menu and then the **NEW PROJECT** button. Then select the newly created project. As you follow the other steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct project selected.

## Enable the Kubernetes Engine API

GKE isn't enabled by default. Search for ""Kubernetes"" in the top search bar and select ""Kubernetes Engine"" from the results.

Select **ENABLE** to enable the Kubernetes Engine API for this project.

## Create a cluster

From the [GKE service page](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview){:target=_blank .external-link}, select **Clusters** > **CREATE**. Make sure you select the ""Standard"" cluster option, n8n doesn't work with an ""Autopilot"" cluster. You can leave the cluster configuration on defaults unless there's anything specifically you need to change, such as location.

## Set Kubectl context

The rest of the steps in this guide require you to set the GCP instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and selecting **CONNECT**. The displayed code snippet shows a connection string for the gcloud CLI tool. Paste and run the code snippet in the gcloud CLI to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new gcloud cluster.

## Clone configuration repository

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/gcp){:target=_blank .external-link} locally. The following steps explain the file configuration and how to add your information.

Clone the repository with the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b gcp
```

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

```shell
cd n8n-kubernetes-hosting
```

## Configure Postgres

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Create a volume for persistent storage

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. Running Postgres on GCP requires a specific Kubernetes Storage Class. You can read [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/deploying-highly-available-postgresql-with-gke){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} for specifics, but the `storage.yaml` manifest creates it for you. You may want to change the regions to create the storage in under the `allowedTopologies` > `matchedLabelExpressions` > `values` key. By default, they're set to `us-central`.

```yaml
…
allowedTopologies:
  - matchLabelExpressions:
      - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
        values:
          - us-central1-b
          - us-central1-c
```

### Postgres environment variables

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n

### Create a volume for file storage

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:

* Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
* If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

```yaml
…
volumes:
  - name: n8n-claim0
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: n8n-claim0
…
```

### Pod resources

[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml` files:

```yaml
…
resources:
  requests:
    memory: ""250Mi""
  limits:
    memory: ""500Mi""
…    
```

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/suggested-pod-resources.md""

### Optional: Environment variables

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
- Define the container image to use
- Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object
- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

## Services

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster

Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f .
```

/// note | Namespace error
You may see an error message about not finding an ""n8n"" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```
///


## Set up DNS

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & Ingress** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **Endpoints** column.

/// note | GKE and IP addresses
[Read this GKE tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/configuring-domain-name-static-ip#configuring_your_domain_name_records){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} for more details on how reserved IP addresses work with GKE and Kubernetes resources.
///
## Delete resources

Remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

```shell
kubectl delete -f .
```

# Hosting n8n on Heroku

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Heroku. It uses:


- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} to create and define the application components and how they work together.
- [Heroku's PostgreSQL service](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/heroku-postgres){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} to host n8n's data storage.
- A **Deploy to Heroku** button offering a one click, with minor configuration, deployment.

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md""

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md""


## Use the deployment template to create a Heroku project

The quickest way to get started with deploying n8n to Heroku is using the **Deploy to Heroku** button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku/tree/main)

This opens the **Create New App** page on Heroku. Set a name for the project, and choose the region to deploy the project to.

### Configure environment variables

Heroku pre-fills the configuration options defined in the `env` section of the `app.json` file, which also sets default values for the environment variables n8n uses.

You can change any of these values to suit your needs. You must change the following values:

- **N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY**, which n8n uses to [encrypt user account details](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) before saving to the database.
- **WEBHOOK_URL** should match the application name you create to ensure that webhooks have the correct URL.

### Deploy n8n

Select **Deploy app**.

After Heroku builds and deploys the app it provides links to **Manage App** or **View** the application.

/// note | Heroku and DNS
Refer to the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/networking-dns){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} to find out how to connect your domain to a Heroku application.
///
## Changing the deployment template

You can make changes to the deployment template by forking the [repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku){:target=_blank .external-link} and deploying from you fork.

### The Dockerfile

By default the Dockerfile pulls the latest n8n image, if you want to use a different or fixed version, then update the image tag on the top line of the `Dockerfile`.

### Heroku and exposing ports

Heroku doesn't allow Docker-based applications to define an exposed port with the `EXPOSE` command. Instead, Heroku provides a `PORT` environment variable that it dynamically populates at application runtime. The `entrypoint.sh` file overrides the default Docker image command to instead set the port variable that Heroku provides. You can then access n8n on port 80 in a web browser.

/// note | Docker limitations with Heroku
[Read this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime#unsupported-dockerfile-commands){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} for more details on the limitations of using Docker with Heroku.
///
### Configuring Heroku

The `heroku.yml` file defines the application you want to create on Heroku. It consists of two sections:

* `setup` > `addons` defines the Heroku addons to use. In this case, the PostgreSQL database addon.
* The `build` section defines how Heroku builds the application. In this case it uses the Docker buildpack to build a `web` service based on the supplied `Dockerfile`.

# Hosting n8n on Hetzner cloud

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on a Hetzner cloud server. It uses:

* [Caddy](http://caddyserver.com){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Server from the internet.
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} to create and define the application components and how they work together.

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/warning.md""

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/installation/latest-next-version.md""

## Create a server

1. [Log in](https://console.hetzner.cloud/){:target=_blank .external-link} to the Hetzner Cloud Console.
2. Select the project to host the server, or create a new project by selecting **+ NEW PROJECT**.
3. Select **+ CREATE SERVER** on the project tile you want to add it to.

You can change most of the settings to suit your needs, but as this guide uses Docker to run the application, under the **Image** section, select ""Docker CE"" from the **APPS** tab.

/// note | Type
When creating the server, Hetzner asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, the CPX11 type is enough.
///
/// note | SSH keys
Hetzner lets you choose between SSH and password-based authentication. SSH is more secure. The rest of this guide assumes you are using SSH.
///
## Log in to your server

The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the server using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [Access with SSH/rsync/BorgBackup](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/access/access-ssh-rsync-borg){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} for more information. You can find the public IP in the listing of the servers in your project.

## Install Docker Compose

The Hetzner Docker app image doesn't have Docker compose installed. Install it with the following commands:

```shell
apt update && apt -y upgrade
apt install docker-compose-plugin
```

## Clone configuration repository

Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy){:target=_blank .external-link} into the root user folder of the server. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.

Clone the repository with the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git
```

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

```shell
cd n8n-docker-caddy
```

## Default folders and files

The host operating system (the server) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:

- `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.
- `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.

### Create Docker volume

To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} that Docker reuses between restarts:

```shell
docker volume create caddy_data
```

Create a Docker volume for the n8n data:

```shell
sudo docker volume create n8n_data
```

## Set up DNS

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the server. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new ""A"" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}.

## Open ports

n8n runs as a web application, so the server needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.

Open the following ports in the server's firewall by running the following two commands:

```shell
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
```

## Configure n8n

n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.

Open the file with the following command:

```shell
nano .env
```

The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.

Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## The Docker Compose file

The Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.

- The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.
- The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.

The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:

```shell
nano docker-compose.yml
```

## Configure Caddy

Caddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.

```shell
nano caddy_config/Caddyfile
```

Change the placeholder subdomain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```text
n8n.<domain>.<suffix> {
    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
      flush_interval -1
    }
}
```

## Start Docker Compose

Start n8n and Caddy with the following command:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

This may take a few minutes.

## Test your setup

In your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.

## Stop n8n and Caddy

You can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:

```shell
sudo docker compose stop
```

To set up logging in n8n, you need to set the following environment variables (you can also set the values in the [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/))

| Setting in the configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| n8n.log.level | N8N_LOG_LEVEL | The log output level. The available options are (from lowest to highest level) are error, warn, info, and debug. The default value is `info`. You can learn more about these options [here](#log-levels). |
| n8n.log.output | N8N_LOG_OUTPUT | Where to output logs. The available options are `console` and `file`. Multiple values can be used separated by a comma (`,`). `console` is used by default. |
| n8n.log.file.location | N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION | The log file location, used only if log output is set to file. By default, `<n8nFolderPath>/logs/n8n.log` is used. |
| n8n.log.file.maxsize | N8N_LOG_FILE_SIZE_MAX | The maximum size (in MB) for each log file. By default, n8n uses 16 MB. |
| n8n.log.file.maxcount | N8N_LOG_FILE_COUNT_MAX | The maximum number of log files to keep. The default value is 100. This value should be set when using workers. |


```bash
# Set the logging level to 'debug'
export N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Set log output to both console and a log file
export N8N_LOG_OUTPUT=console,file

# Set a save location for the log file
export N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION=/home/jim/n8n/logs/n8n.log

# Set a 50 MB maximum size for each log file
export N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXSIZE=50

# Set 60 as the maximum number of log files to be kept
export N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXCOUNT=60
```

### Log levels

n8n uses standard log levels to report:

- `silent`: outputs nothing at all
- `error`: outputs only errors and nothing else
- `warn`: outputs errors and warning messages
- `info`: contains useful information about progress
- `debug`: the most verbose output. n8n outputs a lot of information to help you debug issues.


## Development

During development, adding log messages is a good practice. It assists in debugging errors. To configure logging for development, follow the guide below.

### Implementation details

n8n uses the `LoggerProxy` class, located in the `workflow` package. Calling the `LoggerProxy.init()` by passing in an instance of `Logger`, initializes the class before the usage.

The initialization process happens only once. The [`start.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/commands/start.ts) file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the `LoggerProxy` class.

Once the `Logger` implementation gets created in the `cli` package, it can be obtained by calling the `getInstance` convenience method from the exported module.

Check the [start.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/commands/start.ts) file to learn more about how this process works.

### Adding logs

Once the `LoggerProxy` class gets initialized in the project, you can import it to any other file and add logs.

Convenience methods are provided for all logging levels, so new logs can be added whenever needed using the format `Logger.<logLevel>('<message>', ...meta)`, where `meta` represents any additional properties desired beyond `message`.

In the example above, we use the standard log levels described [above](#log-levels). The `message` argument is a string, and `meta` is a data object.

```js
// You have to import the LoggerProxy. We rename it to Logger to make it easier

import {
	LoggerProxy as Logger
} from 'n8n-workflow';

// Info-level logging of a trigger function, with workflow name and workflow ID as additional metadata properties

Logger.info(`Polling trigger initiated for workflow ""${workflow.name}""`, {workflowName: workflow.name, workflowId: workflow.id});
```

When creating new loggers, some useful standards to keep in mind are:

- Craft log messages to be as human-readable as possible. For example, always wrap names in quotes.
- Duplicating information in the log message and metadata, like workflow name in the above example, can be useful as messages are easier to search and metadata enables easier filtering.
- Include multiple IDs (for example, `executionId`, `workflowId`, and `sessionId`) throughout all logs.
- Use node types instead of node names (or both) as this is more consistent, and so easier to search.

## Front-end logs

As of now, front-end logs aren't available. Using `Logger` or `LoggerProxy` would yield errors in the `editor-ui` package. This functionality will get implemented in the future versions."

# Monitoring

There are three API endpoints you can call to check the status of your instance: `/healthz`, `healthz/readiness`, and `/metrics`.

<!-- vale off -->
## healthz and healthz/readiness
<!-- vale on -->
The `/healthz` endpoint returns a standard HTTP status code. 200 indicates the instance is reachable. It doesn't indicate DB status. It's available for both self-hosted and Cloud users.

Access the endpoint:

```
<your-instance-url>/healthz
```

The `/healthz/readiness` endpoint is similar to the `/healthz` endpoint, but it returns a HTTP status code of 200 if the DB is connected and migrated and therefore the instance is ready to accept traffic.

Access the endpoint:

```
<your-instance-url>/healthz/readiness
```


## metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint provides more detailed information about the current status of the instance.

Access the endpoint:

```
<your-instance-url>/metrics
```

/// info | Feature availability
The `/metrics` endpoint isn't available on n8n Cloud.
///
<!-- vale off -->
## Enable metrics and healthz for self-hosted n8n
<!-- vale on -->
The `/metrics` and `/healthz` endpoints are disabled by default. To enable them, configure your n8n instance:

```shell
# metrics
N8N_METRICS=true
# healthz
QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE=true
```

description: How to handle large files without degrading n8n's performance.
contentType: howto

# Binary data

Binary data is any file-type data, such as image files or documents generated or processed during the execution of a workflow. 

## Enable filesystem mode

When handling binary data, n8n keeps the data in memory by default. This can cause crashes when working with large files. 

To avoid this, change the `N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE` [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/binary-data) to `filesystem`. This causes n8n to save data to disk, instead of using memory.

If you're using queue mode, keep this to `default`. n8n doesn't support filesystem mode with queue mode.

## Binary data pruning

n8n executes binary data pruning as part of execution data pruning. Refer to [Execution data | Enable data pruning](/hosting/scaling/execution-data/#enable-data-pruning) for details. 

If you configure multiple binary data modes, binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. Refer to [External storage](/hosting/scaling/external-storage/#usage) for details."

# Self-hosted concurrency control

/// info | Only for self-hosted n8n
This document is for self-hosted concurrency control. Read [Cloud concurrency](/manage-cloud/concurrency/) to learn how concurrency works with n8n Cloud accounts.
///

In regular mode, n8n doesn't limit how many production executions may run at the same time. This can lead to a scenario where too many concurrent executions thrash the event loop, causing performance degradation and unresponsiveness. 

To prevent this, you can set a concurrency limit for production executions in regular mode. Use this to control how many production executions run concurrently, and queue up any concurrent production executions over the limit. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order.

Concurrency control is disabled by default. To enable it:

```sh
export N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT=20
```

Keep in mind:

- Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, error executions, or started from CLI.
- You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.
- On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.
<!-- vale off -->
- To monitor concurrency control, watch logs for executions being added to the queue and released. In a future version, n8n will show concurrency control in the UI.
<!-- vale on -->

When you enable concurrency control, you can view the number of active executions and the configured limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab.

## Comparison to queue mode

In queue mode, you can control how many jobs a worker may run concurrently using the [`--concurrency` flag](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/#configure-worker-concurrency).

Concurrency control in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency control in regular mode, but the environment variable `N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT` controls both of them. In queue mode, n8n takes the limit from this variable if set to a value other than `-1`, falling back to the `--concurrency` flag or its default."

# Execution data

Depending on your executions settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage.

To avoid this, n8n recommends that you don't save unnecessary data, and enable pruning of old executions data.

To do this, configure the corresponding [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/executions).

## Reduce saved data

/// note | Configuration at workflow level
You can also configure these settings on an individual workflow basis using the [workflow settings](/workflows/workflows/#workflow-settings).
///
You can select which executions data n8n saves. For example, you can save only executions that result in an `Error`.

```sh
# npm
# Save executions ending in errors
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR=all

# Save successful executions
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=all

# Don't save node progress for each execution
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS=false

# Don't save manually launched executions
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS=false

```

```sh
# Docker
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR=all \
 -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=none \
    -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS=true \
    -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS=false \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

```yaml
# Docker Compose
n8n:
    environment:
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR=all
   - EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=none
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS=true
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS=false
```

## Enable data pruning

You can enable data pruning to automatically delete finished executions after a given time. If you don't set `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE`, 336 hours (14 days) is the default.

You can choose to prune finished executions data before the time set in `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE`, using `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT`. This sets a maximum number of executions to store in the database. Once you reach the limit, n8n starts to delete the oldest execution records. This can help with database performance issues, especially if you use SQLite. The database size can still exceed the limit you set: old executions that haven't finished running don't get deleted, even if they would otherwise be subject to deletion.

```sh
# npm
# Activate automatic data pruning
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true

# Number of hours after execution that n8n deletes data
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168

# Number of executions to store
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000
```

```sh
# Docker
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true \
 -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168 \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

```yaml
# Docker Compose
n8n:
    environment:
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168
	  	- EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000
```

/// note | SQLite
If you run n8n using the default SQLite database, the disk space of any pruned data isn't automatically freed up but rather reused for future executions data. To free up this space configure the `DB_SQLITE_VACUUM_ON_STARTUP` [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/database/#sqlite) or manually run the [VACUUM](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html){:target=_blank .external-link} operation.

# External storage

/// info | Feature availability
* Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans
* If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa){:target=_blank .external-link}.
///

n8n can store binary data produced by workflow executions externally. This feature is useful to avoid relying on the filesystem for storing large amounts of binary data. 

n8n will introduce external storage for other data types in the future.

## Storing n8n's binary data in S3

n8n supports [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html){:target=_blank .external-link} as an external store for binary data produced by workflow executions. You can use other S3-compatible services like Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze B2, but n8n doesn't officially support these.

/// info | Enterprise-tier feature
You will need an [Enterprise license key](/enterprise-key/) for external storage. If your license key expires and you remain on S3 mode, the instance will be able to read from, but not write to, the S3 bucket.
///
### Setup

Create and configure a bucket following the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html){:target=_blank .external-link}. You can use the following policy, replacing `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket you created:

```json
{
	""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
	""Statement"": [
		{
			""Sid"": ""VisualEditor0"",
			""Effect"": ""Allow"",
			""Action"": [""s3:*""],
			""Resource"": [""arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>"", ""arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*""]
		}
	]
}
```

Set a bucket-level lifecycle configuration so that S3 automatically deletes old binary data. n8n delegates pruning of binary data to S3, so setting a lifecycle configuration is required unless you want to preserve binary data indefinitely.

Once you finish creating the bucket, you will have a host, bucket name and region, and an access key ID and secret access key. You need to set them in n8n's environment:

```sh
export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_HOST=... # example: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=...
export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION=...
export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=...
export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_SECRET=...
```

/// note | No region
If your provider doesn't require a region, you can set `N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION` to `'auto'`. 
///
Tell n8n to store binary data in S3:

```sh
export N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES=filesystem,s3
export N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=s3
```

Restart the server to load the new configuration.

### Usage

After you enable S3, n8n writes and reads any new binary data to and from the S3 bucket. n8n writes binary data to your S3 bucket in this format:

```
workflows/{workflowId}/executions/{executionId}/binary_data/{binaryFileId}
```

n8n continues to read older binary data stored in the filesystem from the filesystem, if `filesystem` remains listed as an option in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES`.

If you store binary data in S3 and later switch to filesystem mode, the instance continues to read any data stored in S3, as long as `s3` remains listed in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES` and your S3 credentials remain valid.

# Memory-related errors

n8n doesn't restrict the amount of data each node can fetch and process. While this gives you freedom, it can lead to errors when workflow executions require more memory than available. This page explains how to identify and avoid these errors.

/// note | Only for self-hosted n8n
This page describes memory-related errors when [self-hosting n8n](/hosting/). Visit [Cloud data management](/manage-cloud/cloud-data-management/) to learn about memory limits for [n8n Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview/).
///

## Identifying out of memory situations

n8n provides error messages that warn you in some out of memory situations. For example, messages such as **Execution stopped at this node (n8n may have run out of memory while executing it)**.

Error messages including **Problem running workflow**, **Connection Lost**, or **503 Service Temporarily Unavailable** suggest that an n8n instance has become unavailable. 

When self-hosting n8n, you may also see error messages such as **Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory** in your server logs. 

On n8n Cloud, or when using n8n's Docker image, n8n restarts automatically when encountering such an issue. However, when running n8n with npm you might need to restart it manually.

## Typical causes

Such problems occur when a workflow execution requires more memory than available to an n8n instance. Factors increasing the memory usage for a workflow execution include:

- Amount of [JSON data](/data/data-structure/).
- Size of binary data.
- Number of nodes in a workflow.
- Some nodes are memory-heavy: the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node and the older Function node can increase memory consumption significantly.
- Manual or automatic workflow executions: manual executions increase memory consumption as n8n makes a copy of the data for the frontend.
- Additional workflows running at the same time.

## Avoiding out of memory situations

When encountering an out of memory situation, there are two options: either increase the amount of memory available to n8n or reduce the memory consumption.

### Increase available memory

When self-hosting n8n, increasing the amount of memory available to n8n means provisioning your n8n instance with more memory. This may incur additional costs with your hosting provider.

On n8n cloud you need to upgrade to a larger plan.

### Reduce memory consumption

This approach is more complex and means re-building the workflows causing the issue. This section provides some guidelines on how to reduce memory consumption. Not all suggestions are applicable to all workflows.

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/scaling/reduce-memory-consumption.md""

### Increase old memory

This applies to self-hosting n8n. When encountering **JavaScript heap out of memory** errors, it's often useful to allocate additional memory to the old memory section of the V8 JavaScript engine. To do this, set the appropriate [V8 option](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-old-space-sizesize-in-megabytes){:target=_blank .external-link} `--max-old-space-size=SIZE` either through the CLI or through the `NODE_OPTIONS` [environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_optionsoptions){:target=_blank .external-link}."

# Scaling n8n

When running n8n at scale, with a large number of users, workflows, or executions, you need to change your n8n configuration to ensure good performance.

n8n can run in different [modes](/hosting/scaling/execution-modes-processes/) depending on your needs. The `queue` mode provides the best scalability. Refer to [Queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) for configuration details.

You can configure data saving and pruning to improve database performance. Refer to [Execution data](/hosting/scaling/execution-data/) for details."

# Performance and benchmarking

n8n can handle up to 220 workflow executions per second on a single instance, with the ability to scale up further by adding more instances.

This document outlines n8n's performance benchmarking. It describes the factors that affect performance, and includes two example benchmarks.

## Performance factors

The performance of n8n depends on factors including: 

* The workflow type
* The resources available to n8n
* How you configure n8n's scaling options


## Run your own benchmarking

To get an accurate estimate for your use case, run n8n's [benchmarking framework](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/%40n8n/benchmark){:target=_blank .external-link}. The repository contains more information about the benchmarking.

## Example: Single instance performance

This test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.

Setup:

- Hardware: ECS c5a.large instance (4GB RAM)
- n8n setup: Single n8n instance (running in main mode, with Postgres database)
- Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node

<figure markdown>
  ![Graph showing n8n response times by requests per second](/_images/hosting/scaling/benchmarking-single-instance-100-250.png)
  <figcaption>This graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.</figcaption>
</figure>



## Example: Multi-instance performance

This test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.

Setup:

- Hardware: seven ECS c5a.4xlarge instances (8GB RAM each)
- n8n setup: two webhook instances, four worker instances, one database instance (MySQL), one main instance running n8n and Redis
- Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node
- Multi-instance setups use [Queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/)

# Queue mode

You can run n8n in different modes depending on your needs. The queue mode provides the best scalability.

/// note | Binary data storage
n8n doesn't support queue mode with binary data storage. If your workflows need to persist binary data, you can't use queue mode.
///

## How it works

When running in queue mode, you have multiple n8n instances set up, with one main instance receiving workflow information (such as triggers) and the worker instances performing the executions. 

Each worker is its own Node.js instance, running in `main` mode, but able to handle multiple simultaneous workflow executions due to their high IOPS (input-output operations per second). 

By using worker instances and running in queue mode, you can scale n8n up (by adding workers) and down (by removing workers) as needed to handle the workload.

This is the process flow:

1. The main n8n instance handles timers and webhook calls, generating (but not running) a workflow execution. 
1. It passes the execution ID to a message broker, [Redis](#start-redis), which maintains the queue of pending executions and allows the next available worker to pick them up.
1. A worker in the pool picks up message from Redis.
1. The worker uses the execution ID to get workflow information from the database.
1. After completing the workflow execution, the worker:
	- Writes the results to the database.
	- Posts to Redis, saying that the execution has finished.
1. Redis notifies the main instance.


![""Diagram showing the flow of data between the main n8n instance, Redis, the n8n workers, and the n8n database""](/_images/hosting/scaling/queue-mode-flow.png)

## Configuring workers

Workers are n8n instances that do the actual work. They receive information from the main n8n process about the workflows that have to get executed, execute the workflows, and update the status after each execution is complete.

### Set encryption key

n8n automatically generates an encryption key upon first startup. You can also provide your own custom key using [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) if desired.

The encryption key of the main n8n instance must be shared with all worker and webhooks processor nodes to ensure these worker nodes are able to access credentials stored in the database.

Set the encryption key for each worker node in a [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) or by setting the corresponding environment variable:

```bash
export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<main_instance_encryption_key>
```

### Set executions mode

/// note | Database considerations
n8n recommends using Postgres 13+. Running n8n with execution mode set to `queue` with an SQLite database isn't recommended.
///

Set the environment variable `EXECUTIONS_MODE` to `queue` using the following command.

```bash
export EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue
```

Alternatively, you can set `executions.mode` to `queue` in the [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).

### Start Redis

/// note | Running Redis on a separate machine
You can run Redis on a separate machine, just make sure that it's accessible by the n8n instance.
///

To run Redis in a Docker container, follow the instructions below:

Run the following command to start a Redis instance:

```
docker run --name some-redis -p 6379:6379  -d redis
```

By default, Redis runs on `localhost` on port `6379` with no password. Based on your Redis configuration, set the following configurations for the main n8n process. These will allow n8n to interact with Redis.

| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| `queue.bull.redis.host:localhost` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST=localhost` | By default, Redis runs on `localhost`. |
| `queue.bull.redis.port:6379` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT=6379` | The default port is `6379`. If Redis is running on a different port, configure the value. |

You can also set the following optional configurations:

| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| `queue.bull.redis.username:USERNAME` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_USERNAME` | By default, Redis doesn't require a username. If you're using a specific user, configure it variable. |
| `queue.bull.redis.password:PASSWORD` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD` | By default, Redis doesn't require a password. If you're using a password, configure it variable. |
| `queue.bull.redis.db:0` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_DB` | The default value is `0`. If you change this value, update the configuration. |
| `queue.bull.redis.timeoutThreshold:10000ms` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD` | Tells n8n how long it should wait if Redis is unavailable before exiting. The default value is `10000` (ms). |
| `queue.bull.gracefulShutdownTimeout:30` | `N8N_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | A graceful shutdown timeout for workers to finish executing jobs before terminating the process. The default value is `30` seconds. |


Now you can start your n8n instance and it will connect to your Redis instance.

### Start workers

You will need to start worker processes to allow n8n to execute workflows. If you want to host workers on a separate machine, install n8n on the machine and make sure that it's connected to your Redis instance and the n8n database.

Start worker processes by running the following command from the root directory:

```
./packages/cli/bin/n8n worker
```

If you're using Docker, use the following command:

```
docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n worker
```

You can set up multiple worker processes. Make sure that all the worker processes have access to Redis and the n8n database.

#### Worker server

Each worker process runs a server that exposes optional endpoints:

- `/healthz`: returns whether the worker is up, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable
- `/healthz/readiness`: returns whether worker's DB and Redis connections are ready, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable
- [credentials overwrite endpoint](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#credential-overwrites)
- [`/metrics`](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/)

///

You can view running workers and their performance metrics in n8n by selecting **Settings** > **Workers**.

## Running n8n with queues

When running n8n with queues, all the production workflow executions get processed by worker processes. This means that even the webhook calls get delegated to the worker processes, which might add some overhead and extra latency.

Redis acts as the message broker, and the database persists data, so access to both is required. Running a distributed system with this setup over SQLite isn't supported.

/// note | Migrate data
If you want to migrate data from one database to another, you can use the Export and Import commands. Refer to the [CLI commands for n8n](/hosting/cli-commands/#export-workflows-and-credentials) documentation to learn how to use these commands.
///

## Webhook processors

/// note | Keep in mind
Webhook processes rely on Redis too. Follow the [configure the workers](#configuring-workers) section above to setup webhook processor nodes.
///

Webhook processors are another layer of scaling in n8n. Configuring the webhook processor is optional, and allows you to scale the incoming webhook requests.

This method allows n8n to process a huge number of parallel requests. All you have to do is add more webhook processes and workers accordingly. The webhook process will listen to requests on the same port (default: `5678`). Run these processes in containers or separate machines, and have a load balancing system to route requests accordingly.

n8n doesn't recommend adding the main process to the load balancer pool. If you add the main process to the pool, it will receive requests and possibly a heavy load. This will result in degraded performance for editing, viewing, and interacting with the n8n UI.

You can start the webhook processor by executing the following command from the root directory:

```
./packages/cli/bin/n8n webhook
```

If you're using Docker, use the following command:

```
docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n webhook
```

### Configure webhook URL

To configure your webhook URL, execute the following command on the machine running the main n8n instance:

```bash
export WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-url.com
```

You can also set this value in the configuration file.

### Configure load balancer

When using multiple webhook processes you will need a load balancer to route requests. If you are using the same domain name for your n8n instance and the webhooks, you can set up your load balancer to route requests as follows:

- Redirect any request that matches `/webhook/*` to the webhook servers pool
- All other paths (the n8n internal API, the static files for the editor, etc.) should get routed to the main process

**Note:** The default URL for manual workflow executions is `/webhook-test/*`. Make sure that these URLs route to your main process.

You can change this path in the configuration file `endpoints.webhook` or using the `N8N_ENDPOINT_WEBHOOK` environment variable. If you change these, update your load balancer accordingly.

### Disable webhook processing in the main process (optional)

You have webhook processors to execute the workflows. You can disable the webhook processing in the main process. This will make sure to execute all webhook executions in the webhook processors. In the configuration file set `endpoints.disableProductionWebhooksOnMainProcess` to `true` so that n8n doesn't process webhook requests on the main process.

Alternatively, you can use the following command:

```bash
export N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS=true
```

When disabling the webhook process in the main process, run the main process and don't add it to the load balancer's webhook pool.

## Configure worker concurrency

You can define the number of jobs a worker can run in parallel by using the `concurrency` flag. It defaults to `10`. To change it:

```bash
n8n worker --concurrency=5
```

## Multi-main setup

/// info | Feature availability
* Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
* If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa){:target=_blank .external-link}.
///

In queue mode you can run more than one `main` process for high availability.

In a single-mode setup, the `main` process does two sets of tasks: 

- **regular tasks**, such as running the API, serving the UI, and listening for webhooks, and 
- **at-most-once tasks**, such as running non-HTTP triggers (timers, pollers, and persistent connections like RabbitMQ and IMAP), and pruning executions and binary data.

In a multi-main setup, there are two kinds of `main` processes:

- **followers**, which run **regular tasks**, and
- the **leader**, which runs **both regular and at-most-once tasks**.

### Leader designation

In a multi-main setup, all main instances handle the leadership process transparently to users. In case the current leader becomes unavailable, for example because it crashed or its event loop became too busy, other followers can take over. If the previous leader becomes responsive again, it becomes a follower.

### Configuring multi-main setup

To deploy n8n in multi-main setup, ensure: 

- All `main` processes are running in queue mode and are connected to Postgres and Redis.
- All `main` and `worker` processes are running the same version of n8n.
- All `main` processes have set the environment variable `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_ENABLED` to `true`.
- All `main` processes are running behind a load balancer with session persistence (sticky sessions) enabled.

If needed, you can adjust the leader key options:

| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| `multiMainSetup.ttl:10` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_KEY_TTL=10` | Time to live (in seconds) for leader key in multi-main setup. |
| `multiMainSetup.interval:3` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_CHECK_INTERVAL=3` | Interval (in seconds) for leader check in multi-main setup. |

/// note | Keep in mind
In multi-main setup, all `main` processes listen for webhooks, so they fulfill the same purpose as `webhook` processes. Running `webhook` processes is neither needed nor allowed in multi-main setup.

# Block access to nodes

For security reasons, you may want to block your users from accessing or working with specific n8n nodes. This is helpful if your users might be untrustworthy.

Use the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to prevent your users from accessing specific nodes.

## Exclude nodes

Update your `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to include an array of strings containing any nodes you want to block your users from using.

For example, setting the variable this way:

```
NODES_EXCLUDE: ""[\""n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\"", \""n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\""]""
```

Blocks the [Execute Command](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/) and [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) nodes.

Your n8n users won't be able to search for or use these nodes.

## Suggested nodes to block

The nodes that can pose security risks vary based on your use case and user profile. Here are some nodes you might want to start with:

* [Execute Command](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/)
* [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)

## Run task runners as sidecars in external mode

To increase the isolation between the core n8n process and code in the Code node, run task runners in [external mode](/hosting/configuration/task-runners#setting-up-external-mode). External task runners launch as separate containers, providing a fully isolated environment to execute the JavaScript defined in the Code node."

# Securing n8n

Securing your n8n instance can take several forms.

At a high level, you can:

* [Set up SSL](/hosting/securing/set-up-ssl/) to enforce secure connections.
* [Set up Single Sign-On](/hosting/securing/set-up-sso/) for user account management.
* Use [two-factor authentication (2FA)](/user-management/two-factor-auth/) for your users.

More granularly, consider blocking or opting out of features or data collection you don't want:

* [Disable the public API](/hosting/securing/disable-public-api/) if you aren't using it.
* [Opt out of data collection](/hosting/securing/telemetry-opt-out/) of the anonymous data n8n collects automatically.
* [Block certain nodes](/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/) from being available to your users."

# Security audit

You can run a security audit on your n8n instance, to detect common security issues.

## Run an audit

You can run an audit using the CLI, the public API, or the n8n node.


### CLI

Run `n8n audit`.

### API

Make a `POST` call to the `/audit` endpoint. You must authenticate as the instance owner.

### n8n node

Add the [n8n node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to your workflow. Select **Resource** > **Audit** and **Operation** > **Generate**.

## Report contents

The audit generates five risk reports:

### Credentials

This report shows:

* Credentials not used in a workflow.
* Credentials not used in an active workflow.
* Credentials not use in a recently active workflow.

### Database

This report shows:

* Expressions used in **Execute Query** fields in SQL nodes.
* Expressions used in **Query Parameters** fields in SQL nodes.
* Unused **Query Parameters** fields in SQL nodes.

### File system

This report lists nodes that interact with the file system.

### Nodes

This report shows:

* Official risky nodes. These are n8n built in nodes. You can use them to fetch and run any code on the host system, which exposes the instance to exploits. You can view the list in [n8n code | Audit constants](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/security-audit/constants.ts#L51){:target=_blank .external-link}, under `OFFICIAL_RISKY_NODE_TYPES`.

## Use a reverse proxy (recommended)

Use a reverse proxy like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/){:target=_blank .external-link} or a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of the n8n instance. This should also take care of certificate renewals.

Refer to [Security | Data encryption](https://n8n.io/legal/#security){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Pass certificates into n8n directly

You can also choose to pass certificates into n8n directly. To do so, set the `N8N_SSL_CERT` and `N8N_SSL_KEY` environment variables to point to your generated certificate and key file.

You'll need to make sure the certificate stays renewed and up to date.

n8n collects some anonymous data from self-hosted n8n installations. Use the instructions below to opt out of data telemetry collection.

## Collected data

Refer to [Privacy | Data collection in self-hosted n8n](/privacy-security/privacy/#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n) for details on the data n8n collects.

## How collection works

Your n8n instance sends most data to n8n as the events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours). These data types mostly fall into n8n telemetry collection.

## Opting out of data collection

n8n enables telemetry collection by default. To disable it, configure the following environment variables.

### Opt out of telemetry events

To opt out of telemetry events, set the `N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` environment variable to false, for example:

```bash
export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false
```

### Opt out of checking for new versions of n8n

To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n, set the `N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` environment variable to false, for example:

```bash
export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
```

## Predefined credential types

A predefined credential type is a credential that already exists in n8n. You can use predefined credential types instead of generic credentials in the HTTP Request node.

For example: you create an Asana credential, for use with the Asana node. Later, you want to perform an operation that isn't supported by the Asana node, using Asana's API. You can use your existing Asana credential in the HTTP Request node to perform the operation, without additional authentication setup.

### Using predefined credential types

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/predefined-credential-type-how-to.md""


### Credential scopes

Some existing credential types have specific scopes: endpoints that they work with. n8n warns you about this when you select the credential type.

For example, follow the steps in [Using predefined credential types](#using-predefined-credential-types), and select **Google Calendar OAuth2 API** as your **Credential Type**. n8n displays a box listing the two endpoints you can use this credential type with:

# Integrations

n8n calls integrations nodes.

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows in n8n. They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows.

## Built-in nodes

n8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to [Built-in nodes](/integrations/builtin/node-types/) for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes.

## Community nodes

As well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for more information.

## Credential-only nodes and custom operations

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/credential-only-intro.md""

Refer to [Custom operations](/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.

## Generic integrations

If you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call.

# Built-in integrations

This section contains the node library: reference documentation for every built-in node in n8n, and their credentials.

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/node-operations.md""

## Core nodes

Core nodes can be actions or triggers. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls.

## Cluster nodes

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/cluster-nodes-summary.md""

## Credentials

External services need a way to identify and authenticate users. This data can range from an API key over an email/password combination to a long multi-line private key. You can save these in n8n as credentials.

Nodes in n8n can then request that credential information. As another layer of security, only node types with specific access rights can access the credentials.

To make sure that the data is secure, it gets saved to the database encrypted. n8n uses a random personal encryption key, which it automatically generates on the first run of n8n and then saved under `~/.n8n/config`.

To learn more about creating, managing, and sharing credentials, refer to [Manage credentials](/credentials/).

## Community nodes

n8n supports custom nodes built by the community. Refer to [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on installing and using these nodes.

title: Handling API rate limits
pageType: howto
description: How to handle API rate limits when using n8n integrations.
---

# Handling API rate limits

API rate limits are restrictions on request frequency. For example, an API may limit the number of requests you can make per minute, or per day.

APIs can also limits how much data you can send in one request, or how much data the API sends in a single response.

## Identify rate limit issues

When an n8n node hits a rate limit, it errors. n8n displays the error message in the node output panel. This includes the error message from the service.

If n8n received error 429 (too many requests) from the service, the error message is **The service is receiving too many requests from you**.

To check the rate limits for the service you're using, refer to the API documentation for the service.

## Handle rate limits for integrations

There are two ways to handle rate limits in n8n's integrations: using the Retry On Fail setting, or using a combination of the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) and [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) nodes: 

* Retry On Fail adds a pause between API request attempts.
* With Loop Over Items and Wait you can break you request data into smaller chunks, as well as pausing between requests.

### Enable Retry On Fail

When you enable Retry On Fail, the node automatically tries the request again if it fails the first time.

1. Open the node.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Enable the **Retry On Fail** toggle.
1. Configure the retry settings: if using this to work around rate limits, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to more than the rate limit. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.

### Use Loop Over Items and Wait

Use the Loop Over Items node to batch the input items, and the Wait node to introduce a pause between each request.

1. Add the Loop Over Items node before the node that calls the API. Refer to [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) for information on how to configure the node.
1. Add the Wait node after the node that calls the API, and connect it back to the Loop Over Items node. Refer to [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) for information on how to configure the node.

For example, to handle rate limits when using OpenAI:

![""Screenshot of a workflow using the Loop Over Items node and Wait node to handle API rate limits for the OpenAI APIs""](/_images/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/loop-wait.png)

## Handle rate limits in the HTTP Request node

The HTTP Request node has built-in settings for handling rate limits and large amounts of data.

### Batch requests

Use the Batching option to send more than one request, reducing the request size, and introducing a pause between requests. This is the equivalent of using Loop Over Items and Wait.

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Batching**.
1. Set **Items per Batch**: this is the number of input items to include in each request.
1. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.

### Paginate results

APIs paginate their results when they need to send more data than they can handle in a single response. For more information on pagination in the HTTP Request node, refer to [HTTP Request node | Pagination](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/#pagination)."

n8n provides a trigger node for Airtable. You can find the trigger node docs [here](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtabletrigger/).

Refer to [Airtable's documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/operation-not-supported.md""


## Node reference

### Get the Record ID

To fetch data for a particular record, you need the Record ID. There are two ways to get the Record ID.

### Create a Record ID column in Airtable

To create a `Record ID` column in your table, refer to this [article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids){:target=_blank .external-link}. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Use the List operation

To get the Record ID of your record, you can use the **List** operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Filter records when using the List operation

To filter records from your Airtable base, use the **Filter By Formula** option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization `n8n`, follow the steps mentioned below:
1. Select 'List' from the **Operation** dropdown list.
2. Enter the base ID and the table name in the **Base ID** and **Table** field, respectively.
3. Click on **Add Option** and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.
4. Enter the following formula in the **Filter By Formula** field: `{Organization}='n8n'`.

Similarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization `n8n`, use the following formula: `NOT({Organization}='n8n')`.

Refer to the Airtable [documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference){:target=_balnk .external-link} to learn more about the formulas."

## Get the Row ID

To update or delete a particular record, you need the Row ID. There are two ways to get the Row ID:

**Create a Row ID column in Grist**

Create a new column in your Grist table with the formula `$id`.

**Use the Get All operation**

The **Get All** operation returns the Row ID of each record along with the fields.
 
You can get it with the expression `{{$node[""GristNodeName""].json[""id""]}}`.


## Filter records when using the Get All operation

- Select **Add Option** and select **Filter** from the dropdown list.
- You can add filters for any number of columns. The result will only include records which match all the columns.
- For each column, you can enter any number of values separated by commas. The result will include records which match any of the values for that column."

## Fetch issues for a specific project

The **Get All** operation returns all the issues from Jira. To fetch issues for a particular project, you need to use Jira Query Language (JQL).

For example, if you want to receive all the issues of a project named `n8n`, you'd do something like this:

- Select **Get All** from the **Operation** dropdown list.
- Toggle **Return All** to true.
- Select **Add Option** and select **JQL**.
- Enter `project=n8n` in the **JQL** field.

This query will fetch all the issues in the project named `n8n`. Enter the name of your project instead of `n8n` to fetch all the issues for your project."

## Options

### Query Options

The Query Submission operation supports query options:

* In the main section of the **Parameters** panel:
    * **Start** controls the index offset to start the query from (to use the API pagination logic).
    * **Limit** sets the maximum number of records to return. Note that the API always has a limit of 30,000 returned records, whatever value you provide.
* In the **Query Options** section, you can activate the following parameters:
    * **Query** lets you specify filter predicates in MongoDB's JSON query format. For example: `{""status"": ""success"", ""_submission_time"": {""$lt"": ""2021-11-01T01:02:03""}}` queries for all submissions with the value `success` for the field `status`, and submitted before November 1st, 2021, 01:02:03.
    * **Fields** lets you specify the list of fields you want to fetch, to make the response lighter.
    * **Sort** lets you provide a list of sorting criteria in MongoDB JSON format. For example, `{""status"": 1, ""_submission_time"": -1}` specifies a sort order by ascending status, and then descending submission time.

More details about these options can be found in the [Formhub API docs](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Formhub-Access-Points-(API)#api-parameters)

### Submission options

All operations that return form submission data offer options to tweak the response. These include:

- Download options lets you download any attachment linked to each particular form submissions, such as pictures and videos. It also lets you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images). 
- Formatting options perform some reformatting as described in [About reformatting](#about-reformatting).

#### About reformatting

The default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings.

This node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the **Reformat?** parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations.

When enabled, the reformatting:

- Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a `/` character in the field names, for example `Group1/Question1`. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into `Group1.Question1`, as nested JSON objects.
- Renames fields to trim `_` (not supported by many downstream systems).
- Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent.
- Splits all fields matching any of the **Multiselect Mask** wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the `*` wildcard.
- Converts all fields matching any of the **Number Mask** wildcard masks into a JSON float.

Here's a detailed example in JSON:

```json
{
  ""_id"": 471987,
  ""formhub/uuid"": ""189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6"",
  ""start"": ""2021-12-05T16:13:38.527+02:00"",

  ""_tags"": [],
  ""_notes"": [],
  ""_validation_status"": {},
  ""_submitted_by"": null
}
```

With reformatting enabled, and the appropriate masks for multi-select and number formatting (for example, `Crops_*` and `*_sqm` respectively), n8n parses it into:

```json

## Find the folder ID

To perform operations on folders, you need to supply the ID. You can find this:

* In the URL of the folder
* By searching for it using the node. You need to do this if using MS 365 (where OneDrive uses SharePoint behind the scenes):
	1. Select **Resource** > **Folder**.
	2. Select **Operation** > **Search**.
	3. In **Query**, enter the folder name.
	4. Select **Test step**. n8n runs the query and returns data about the folder, including an `id` field containing the folder ID."

# Gmail node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Gmail node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages

If you're using the node to [send a message](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations/#send-a-message) or [reply to a message](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations/#reply-to-a-message), the node appends this statement to the end of the email:

> This email was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

1. In the node's **Options** section, select **Add option**.
2. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
3. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send options](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations/#send-options) and [Reply options](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations/#reply-options) for more information.

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials

This error displays next to certain dropdowns in the node, like the **Label Names or IDs** dropdown. The full text looks something like this:

```
There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: ""Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?""
```

The error most often displays when you're using a Google Service Account as the credential and the credential doesn't have **Impersonate a User** turned on.

Refer to [Google Service Account: Finish your n8n credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account/#finish-your-n8n-credential) for more information.

## 401 unauthorized error

The full text of the error looks like this:
<!--vale off-->
```
401 - {""error"":""unauthorized_client"",""error_description"":""Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested.""}
```
<!--vale on-->

This error occurs when there's an issue with the credential you're using and its scopes or permissions.

To resolve:

1. For [OAuth2](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service/) credentials, make sure you've enabled the Gmail API in **APIs & Services > Library**. Refer to [Google OAuth2 Single Service - Enable APIs](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service/#enable-apis) for more information.
2. For [Service Account](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account/) credentials:
    1. [Enable domain-wide delegation](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account/#enable-domain-wide-delegation).
    2. Make sure you add the Gmail API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error most often occurs if you enter a Message ID, Thread ID, or Label ID that doesn't exist.

Try a **Get** operation with the ID to confirm it exists."

# Google Drive node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Drive node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Google hasn't verified this app

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/unverified-app.md""

## Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/app-becoming-unauthorized.md""

## Google Drive OAuth error

If using the OAuth authentication method, you may see an error indicating that you can't sign in because the app doesn't meet Google's expectations for keeping apps secure.

Most often, the actual cause of this issue is that the URLs don't match between Google's OAuth configuration and n8n. To avoid this, start by reviewing any links included in Google's error message. This will contain details about the exact error that occurred.

If you are self-hostin n8n, check the n8n configuration items used to construct external URLs. Verify that the [`N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) and [`WEBHOOK_URL`](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) environment variables use fully qualified domains.

## Get recent files from Google Drive

To retrieve recent files from Google Drive, you need to sort files by modification time. To do this, you need to search for existing files and retrieve their modification times. Next you can sort the files to find the most recent file and use another Google Drive node target the file by ID.

The process looks like this:

1. Add a **Google Drive** node to your canvas.
2. Select the **File/Folder** resource and the **Search** operation.
3. Enable **Return All** to sort through all files.
4. Set the **What to Search** filter to **Files**.
5. In the **Options**, set the **Fields** to **All**.
6. Connect a **Sort** node to the output of the **Google Drive** node.
7. Choose **Simple** sort type.
8. Enter `modifiedTime` as the **Field Name** in the **Fields To Sort By** section.
9. Choose **Descending** sort order.
10. Add a **Limit** node to the output of the **Sort** node.
11. Set **Max Items** to **1** to keep the most recent file.
12. Connect another **Google Drive** node to the output of the **Limit** node.
13. Select **File** as the **Resource** and the operation of your choice.
14. In the **File** selection, choose **By ID**.
15. Select **Expression** and enter `{{ $json.id }}` as the expression.

# Google Sheets node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Sheets node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Append an array

To insert an array of data into Google Sheets, you must convert the array into a valid JSON (key, value) format.

To do so, consider using:

1. The [Split Out](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/) node.
1. The [AI Transform](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/) node. For example, try entering something like:
    ```
    Convert 'languages' array to JSON (key, value) pairs.
    ```
1. The [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

<!-- vale off -->
## Column names were updated after the node's setup
<!-- vale on -->

You'll receive this error if the Google Sheet's column names have changed since you set up the node.

To refresh the column names, re-select **Mapping Column Mode**. This should prompt the node to fetch the column names again.

Once the column names refresh, update the node parameters."

# MySQL node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [MySQL node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Update rows by composite key

The MySQL node's **Update** operation lets you to update rows in a table by providing a **Column to Match On** and a value. This works for tables where single column values can uniquely identify individual rows.

You can't use this pattern for tables that use [composite keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key), where you need multiple columns to uniquely identify a row. A example of this is MySQL's [`user` table](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql-user-table/) in the `mysql` database, where you need both the `user` and `host` columns to uniquely identify rows.

To update tables with composite keys, write the query manually with the **Execute SQL** operation instead. There, you can match on multiple values, like in this example which matches on both `customer_id` and `product_id`: 

```sql
UPDATE orders SET quantity = 3 WHERE customer_id = 538 AND product_id = 800;
```

## Can't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker

When you run either n8n or MySQL in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to MySQL.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only MySQL is in Docker

If only MySQL is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the port](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306, so your Docker command should look like this:

```shell
docker run -p 3306:3306 --name my-mysql -d mysql:latest
```

When configuring [MySQL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [MySQL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/), use `host.docker.internal` as the **Host** address instead of `localhost`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and MySQL are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). Add both the MySQL and n8n containers to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/).

When configuring [MySQL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/), use the MySQL container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the MySQL container `my-mysql`, you would set the **Host** to `my-mysql`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure MySQL to listen on `localhost` and configure the **Host** in the [MySQL credentials in n8n](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to use `localhost`.

## Decimal numbers returned as strings

By default, the MySQL node returns [`DECIMAL` values](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/fixed-point-types.html) as strings. This is done intentionally to avoid loss of precision that can occur due to limitation with the way JavaScript represents numbers. You can learn more about the decision in the documentation for the [MySQL library](https://sidorares.github.io/node-mysql2/docs/api-and-configurations) that n8n uses.

To output decimal values as numbers instead of strings and ignore the risks in loss of precision, enable the **Output Decimals as Numbers** option. This will output the values as numbers instead of strings.

As an alternative, you can manually	convert from the string to a decimal using the [`toFloat()` function](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/strings/#string-toFloat) with [`toFixed()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) or with the [Edit Fields (Set) node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) after the MySQL node. Be aware that you may still need to account for a potential loss of precision."

Refer to [MySQL's Connectors and APIs documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-connectors.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

Refer to MySQL's [SELECT statement documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/select.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on writing SQL queries.

## Use query parameters

When creating a query to run on a MySQL database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:

```js
[
    {
        ""email"": ""alex@example.com"",
        ""name"": ""Alex"",
        ""age"": 21 
    },
    {
        ""email"": ""jamie@example.com"",
        ""name"": ""Jamie"",
        ""age"": 33 
    }
]
```

You can write a query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;
```

Then in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:

```js
// users is an example table name
users, {{ $json.email }} 
```

# Postgres node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Postgres node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Dynamically populate SQL `IN` groups with parameters

In Postgres, you can use the SQL [`IN` comparison construct](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-comparisons.html#FUNCTIONS-COMPARISONS-IN-SCALAR) to make comparisons between groups of values:

```sql
SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ('small', 'medium', 'large');
```

While you can use n8n [expressions](/code/expressions/) in your query to dynamically populate the values in an `IN` group, combining this with [query parameters](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/#use-query-parameters) provides extra protection by automatically sanitizing input.

To construct an `IN` group query with query parameters:

1. Set the **Operation** to **Execute Query**.
2. In **Options**, select **Query Parameters**.
3. Use an expression to select an array from the input data. For example, `{{ $json.input_shirt_sizes }}`.
4. In the **Query** parameter, write your query with the `IN` construct with an empty set of parentheses. For example:
	```sql
	SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ();
	```
5. Inside of the `IN` parentheses, use an expression to dynamically create index-based placeholders (like `$1`, `$2`, and `$3`) for the number of items in your query parameter array. You can do this by increasing each array index by one since the placeholder variables are 1 indexed:
	```sql
	SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ({{ $json.input_shirt_sizes.map((i, pos) => ""$"" + (pos+1)).join(', ') }});
	```

With this technique, n8n automatically creates the correct number of [prepared statement placeholders](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html) for the `IN` values according to the number of items in your array.

## Working with timestamps and time zones

To avoid complications with how n8n and Postgres interpret timestamp and time zone data, follow these general tips:

- **Use UTC when storing and passing dates**: Using UTC helps avoid confusion over timezone conversions when converting dates between different representations and systems.
- **Set the execution timezone**: Set the global timezone in n8n using either [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/time-zone/) (for self-hosted) or in the [settings](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) (for n8n Cloud). You can set a workflow-specific timezone in the [workflow settings](/workflows/settings/).
- **Use ISO 8601 format**: The [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) encodes the day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, and seconds in a standardized string. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings and uses [Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/) to parse dates. If you need to cast to ISO 8601 explicitly, you can use the [Date & Time node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) and a custom format set to the string `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`."

## Related resources

n8n provides a trigger node for Postgres. You can find the trigger node docs [here](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgrestrigger/).

## Use query parameters

When creating a query to run on a Postgres database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:

```js
[
    {
        ""email"": ""alex@example.com"",
        ""name"": ""Alex"",
        ""age"": 21 
    },
    {
        ""email"": ""jamie@example.com"",
        ""name"": ""Jamie"",
        ""age"": 33 
    }
]
```

You can write a query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;
```

Then in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:

```js
// users is an example table name
users, {{ $json.email }} 
```

# Telegram node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add a bot to a Telegram channel

For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like:
`Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel`.

To add a bot to a channel:

1. In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.
2. Label the channel name as **public channel**.
3. Select **Administrators** > **Add Admin**.
4. Search for the bot's username and select it.
5. Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.

## Get the Chat ID

You can only use `@channelusername` on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.

There are three ways to get that ID:

1. From the Telegram Trigger: Use the [Telegram Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/) node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.
2. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter ""g."" Prefix your group Chat ID with a `-` when you enter it in n8n.
3. Invite Telegram's [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot){:target=_blank .external-link} to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a `chat` object. The `id` for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.

## Send more than 30 messages per second

The Telegram API has a [limitation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#broadcasting-to-users){:target=_blank .external-link} of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:

1. **Loop Over Items node**: Use the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.
2. **Telegram node**: Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the **Expression Editor** to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.
3. **Code node**: Connect the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.

You can also use this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/772){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages

If you're using the node to [send Telegram messages](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/message-operations/#send-message), the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:

> This message was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

1. In the node's **Additional Fields** section, select **Add Field**.
2. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
3. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send Message additional fields](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/message-operations/#send-message-additional-fields) for more information."

# WhatsApp Business Cloud node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [WhatsApp Business Cloud node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.whatsapp/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error occurs when WhatsApp Business Cloud rejects your request because of a problem with its parameters. It's common to see this when using the **Send Template** operation if the data you send doesn't match the format of your template.

To resolve this issue, review the parameters in your [message template](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2055875911147364?id=2129163877102343). Pay attention to each parameter's data type and the order they're defined in the template.

Check the data that n8n is mapping to the template parameters. If you're using expressions to set parameter values, check the input data to make sure each item resolves to a valid value. You may want to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) or [set a fallback value](/code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/) to ensure you send a value with the correct format.

## Working with non-text media

The WhatsApp Business Cloud node can work with non-text messages and media like images, audio, documents, and more.

If your operation includes a **Input Data Field Name** or **Property Name** parameter, set this to the field name itself rather than referencing the data in an expression.

For example, if you are trying to send a message with an ""Image"" **MessageType** and **Take Image From** set to ""n8n"", set **Input Data Field Name** to a field name like `data` instead of an expression like `{{ $json.input.data }}`."

  ```
  Always respond in a friendly and engaging manner. When a user asks a question, provide a concise answer first, followed by a brief explanation or additional context if necessary. If the question is open-ended, offer a suggestion or ask a clarifying question to guide the conversation. Keep the tone positive and supportive, and avoid technical jargon unless specifically requested by the user.
  ```
- **Code Interpreter**: Turn on to enable the code interpreter for the assistant, where it can write and execute code in a sandbox environment. Enable this tool for tasks that require computations, data analysis, or any logic-based processing.
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Turn on to enable knowledge retrieval for the assistant, allowing it to access external sources or a connected knowledge base.

# OpenAI Text operations

Use this operation to message a model or classify text for violations in OpenAI. Refer to [OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.openai/) for more information on the OpenAI node itself.

## Message a Model

Use this operation to send a message or prompt to an OpenAI model and receive a response.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/).
- **Resource**: Select **Text**.
- **Operation**: Select **Message a Model**.
- **Model**: Select the model you want to use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try `gpt-4o` if you need high intelligence or `gpt-4o-mini` if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to [Models overview | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. 
- **Messages**: Enter a **Text** prompt and assign a **Role** that the model will use to generate responses. Refer to [Prompt engineering | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on how to write a better prompt by using these roles. Choose from one of these roles: 
    - **User**: Sends a message as a user and gets a response from the model. 
    - **Assistant**: Tells the model to adopt a specific tone or personality. 
    - **System**: By default, the system message is `""You are a helpful assistant""`. You can define instructions in the user message, but the instructions set in the system message are more effective. You can only set one system message per conversation. Use this to set the model's behavior or context for the next user message. 
- **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data. 
- **Output Content as JSON**: Turn on to attempt to return the response in JSON format. Compatible with `GPT-4 Turbo` and all `GPT-3.5 Turbo` models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

### Options

- **Frequency Penalty**: Apply a penalty to reduce the model's tendency to repeat similar lines. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.
- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response. One token is roughly four characters for standard English text. Use this to limit the length of the output. 
- **Number of Completions**: Defaults to 1. Set the number of completions you want to generate for each prompt. Use carefully since setting a high number will quickly consume your tokens. 
- **Presence Penalty**: Apply a penalty to influence the model to discuss new topics. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.
- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around `0.7`) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`. 
- **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`. 

Refer to [Message a Model | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/text-completion/create){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.

## Classify Text for Violations

Use this operation to identify and flag content that might be harmful. OpenAI model will analyze the text and return a response containing:

- `flagged`: A boolean field indicating if the content is potentially harmful.
- `categories`: A list of category-specific violation flags.
- `category_scores`: Scores for each category.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/).
- **Resource**: Select **Text**.
- **Operation**: Select **Classify Text for Violations**.
- **Text Input**: Enter text to classify if it violates the moderation policy. 
- **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.

### Options

- **Use Stable Model**: Turn on to use the stable version of the model instead of the latest version, accuracy may be slightly lower.

Refer to [Moderations | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.

## Chat Messages

Use **Chat Messages** when you're using a chat model to set a message.

n8n ignores these options if you don't connect a chat model. Select the **Type Name or ID** you want the node to use:

#### AI

Enter a sample expected response in the **Message** field. The model will try to respond in the same way in its messages.

#### System

Enter a system **Message** to include with the user input to help guide the model in what it should do.

Use this option for things like defining tone, for example: `Always respond talking like a pirate`.

#### User

Enter a sample user input. Using this with the AI option can help improve the output of the agent. Using both together provides a sample of an input and expected response (the **AI Message**) for the model to follow.

Select one of these input types:

* **Text**: Enter a sample user input as a text **Message**.
* **Image (Binary)**: Select a binary input from a previous node. Enter the **Image Data Field Name** to identify which binary field from the previous node contains the image data.
* **Image (URL)**: Use this option to feed an image in from a URL. Enter the **Image URL**.

For both the **Image** types, select the **Image Details** to control how the model processes the image and generates its textual understanding. Choose from:

* **Auto**: The model uses the auto setting, which looks at the image input size and decide if it should use the Low or High setting.
* **Low**: The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image and represents the image with a budget of 65 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens. Use this option for use cases that don't require high detail.
* **High**: The model can access the low-resolution image and then creates detailed crops of input images as 512px squares based on the input image size. Each of the detailed crops uses twice the token budget (65 tokens) for a total of 129 tokens. Use this option for use cases that require high detail.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Basic LLM Chain node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### No prompt specified error

This error displays when the **Prompt** is empty or invalid.

You might see this error in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and haven't entered anything in the **Text** field.
    * To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.
2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Take from previous node automatically** and the incoming data has no field called `chatInput`. 
    * The node expects the `chatInput` field. If your previous node doesn't have this field, add an [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`."

# LangChain Code node

Use the LangChain Code node to import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it. By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors you can use it as a normal node, root node or sub-node.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters, guidance on configuring the node, and links to more resources.

/// note | Not available on Cloud
This node is only available on self-hosted n8n.
///

## Node parameters

### Add Code

Add your custom code. Choose either **Execute** or **Supply Data** mode. You can only use one mode.

Unlike the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/), the LangChain Code node doesn't support Python.

* **Execute**: use the LangChain Code node like n8n's own Code node. This takes input data from the workflow, processes it, and returns it as the node output. This mode requires a main input and output. You must create these connections in **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
* **Supply Data**: use the LangChain Code node as a sub-node, sending data to a root node. This uses an output other than main.

By default, you can't load built-in or external modules in this node. Self-hosted users can [enable built-in and external modules](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/).

### Inputs

Choose the input types. 

The main input is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

### Outputs

Choose the output types. 

The main output is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

## Node inputs and outputs configuration

By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors (inputs and outputs) you can use it as an app node, root node or sub-node.

![Screenshot of a workflow with four LangChain nodes, configured as different node types](/_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchaincode/create-node-types.png)

| Node type | Inputs | Outputs | Code mode |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | --------- |
| App node. Similar to the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/). | Main | Main | Execute |
| Root node | Main; at least one other type | Main | Execute |
| Sub-node | - | A type other than main. Must match the input type you want to connect to. | Supply Data |
| Sub-node with sub-nodes | A type other than main |A type other than main. Must match the input type you want to connect to. | Supply Data |

## Built-in methods

n8n provides these methods to make it easier to perform common tasks in the LangChain Code node.

# Information Extractor node

Use the Information Extractor node to extract structured information from incoming data.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Information Extractor node,
and links to more resources.

## Node parameters

* **Text** defines the input text to extract information from. This is usually an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is a chat trigger, or `{{ $json.text }}` if a previous node is Extract from PDF.
* Use **Schema Type** to choose how you want to describe the desired output data format. You can choose between:
    * **From Attribute Description**: This option allows you to define the schema by specifying the list of attributes and their descriptions.
    * **Generate From JSON Example**: Input an example JSON object to automatically generate the schema. The node uses the object property types and names. It ignores the actual values.
    * **Define Below**: Manually input the JSON schema. Read the JSON Schema [guides and examples](https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples){:target=_blank .external-link} for help creating a valid JSON schema.

## Node options

* **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the information extraction. n8n automatically appends format specification instructions to the prompt.

# Sentiment Analysis node

Use the Sentiment Analysis node to analyze the sentiment of incoming text data.

The language model uses the [**Sentiment Categories**](#node-options) in the node options to determine each item's sentiment.

## Node parameters

* **Text to Analyze** defines the input text for sentiment analysis. This is an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be 
`{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is from a chat or message source. By default, it expects a `text` field.

## Node options

* **Sentiment Categories**: Define the categories that you want to classify your input as.
    * By default, these are `Positive, Neutral, Negative`. You can customize these categories to fit your specific use case, such as `Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative` for more granular analysis.
* **Include Detailed Results**: When turned on, this option includes sentiment strength and confidence scores in the output. Note that these scores are estimates generated by the language model and are rough indicators rather than precise measurements.
* **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the sentiment analysis. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.
* **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

## Usage Notes

### Model Temperature Setting

It's strongly advised to set the temperature of the connected language model to 0 or a value close to 0. This helps ensure that the results are as deterministic as possible, providing more consistent and reliable sentiment analysis across multiple runs.

### Language Considerations

The node's performance may vary depending on the language of the input text.

For best results, ensure your chosen language model supports the input language.

### Processing Large Volumes

When analyzing large amounts of text, consider splitting the input into smaller chunks to optimize processing time and resource usage.

### Iterative Refinement

For complex sentiment analysis tasks, you may need to iteratively refine the system prompt and categories to achieve the desired results.

## Example Usage

### Basic Sentiment Analysis

1. Connect a data source (for example, RSS Feed, HTTP Request) to the Sentiment Analysis node.
2. Set the ""Text to Analyze"" field to the relevant item property (for example, `{{ $json.content }}` for blog post content).
3. Keep the default sentiment categories.
4. Connect the node's outputs to separate paths for processing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments differently.

### Custom Category Analysis

1. Change the **Sentiment Categories** to `Excited, Happy, Neutral, Disappointed, Angry`.
2. Adjust your workflow to handle these five output categories.
3. Use this setup to analyze customer feedback with more nuanced emotional categories.

# Text Classifier node

Use the Text Classifier node to classify (categorize) incoming data. Using the categories provided in the parameters (see below), each item is passed to the model to determine its category.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Text Classifier node, and links to more resources.

## Node parameters

* **Input Prompt** defines the input to classify. This is usually an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is a chat trigger. By default it references the `text` field.
* **Categories**: Add the categories that you want to classify your input as. Categories have a name and a description. Use the description to tell the model what the category means. This is important if the meaning isn't obvious. You can add as many categories as you like.

## Node options

* **Allow Multiple Classes To Be True**: You can configure the classifier to always output a single class per item (turned off), or allow the model to select multiple classes (turned on).
* **When No Clear Match**: Define what happens if the model can't find a good match for an item. There are two options:
	- **Discard Item** (the default): If the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it drops the item.
	- **Output on Extra, 'Other' Branch**: Creates a separate output branch called **Other**. When the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it outputs items in this branch.
* **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the classification. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.

* **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

# AI Agent node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [AI Agent node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Internal error: 400 Invalid value for 'content'

A full error message might look like this:

```
Internal error
Error: 400 Invalid value for 'content': expected a string, got null.
<stack-trace>
```

This error can occur if the **Prompt** input contains a null value.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
    * To resolve, make sure your expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Take from previous node automatically** and the incoming data has null values.
    * To resolve, remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

## Error in sub-node Window Buffer Memory

This error displays when n8n runs into an issue with the [Window Buffer Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/) sub-node.

It most often occurs when your workflow or the workflow template you copied uses an older version of the Window Buffer Memory node.

Try removing the Window Buffer Memory node from your workflow and re-adding it, which will guarantee you're using the latest version of the node.

## A Chat Model sub-node must be connected error

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Chat Model connected.

To resolve this, click the + Chat Model button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Chat Model + connector when the node is closed. n8n will then open a selection of possible Chat Models to pick from.

## No prompt specified error

This error occurs when the agent expects to get the prompt from the previous node automatically. Typically, this happens when you're using the [Chat Trigger Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/). 

To resolve this issue, find the **Prompt** parameter of the AI Agent node and change it from **Take from previous node automatically** to **Define below**. This allows you to manually build your prompt by referencing output data from other nodes or by adding static text."

# Conversational AI Agent node

The Conversational Agent has human-like conversations. It can maintain context, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers. This agent is typically used for building chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems.

The Conversational Agent describes tools in the system prompt and parses JSON responses for tool calls. If your preferred AI model doesn't support tool calling or you're handling simpler interactions, this agent is a good general option. It's more flexible but may be less accurate than the [Tools Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index/) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/use-with-chat-trigger.md""

## Node parameters

Configure the Conversational Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/prompt.md""

### Require Specific Output Format

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/output-format.md""

## Node options

Refine the Conversational Agent node's behavior using these options:

### Human Message

Tell the agent about the tools it can use and add context to the user's input.

You must include these expressions and variable:

* `{tools}`: A LangChain expression that provides a string of the tools you've connected to the Agent. Provide some context or explanation about who should use the tools and how they should use them.
* `{format_instructions}`: A LangChain expression that provides the schema or format from the output parser node you've connected. Since the instructions themselves are context, you don't need to provide context for this expression.
* `{{input}}`: A LangChain variable containing the user's prompt. This variable populates with the value of the **Prompt** parameter. Provide some context that this is the user's input.

Here's an example of how you might use these strings:

Example:

```
TOOLS
------
Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the user's original question. The tools the human can use are:

{tools}

{format_instructions}

USER'S INPUT
--------------------
Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a JSON blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):

{{input}}

# AI Agent node

An AI agent is an autonomous system that receives data, makes rational decisions, and acts within its environment to achieve specific goals. The AI agent's environment is everything the agent can access that isn't the agent itself, which might include customer queries, tools, or other context.

The AI Agent node gives you six LangChain agent options.

On this page, you'll find a summary of the available agents with links to more detailed pages on each, templates and examples, and links to more resources.

/// note | Connect a tool
You must connect at least one tool [sub-node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/) to an AI Agent node.
///

## Available agents

n8n provides these agents:

* [**Tools Agent**](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/) (default): This agent uses external tools and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task. This agent helps integrate LLMs with various external services and databases.

    /// note | Begin here
    n8n recommends using this agent for most use cases. It will handle most scenarios and provides the best experience when working with [tools](/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/).
    ///

# ReAct AI Agent node

The ReAct Agent node implements [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/){:target=_blank .external-link} logic. ReAct (reasoning and acting) brings together the reasoning powers of chain-of-thought prompting and action plan generation.

The ReAct Agent reasons about a given task, determines the necessary actions, and then executes them. It follows the cycle of reasoning and acting until it completes the task. The ReAct agent can break down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks, prioritise them, and execute them one after the other.

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index/) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

/// note | No memory
The ReAct agent doesn't support memory sub-nodes. This means it can't recall previous prompts or simulate an ongoing conversation.
///

## Node parameters

Configure the ReAct Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/prompt.md""

### Require Specific Output Format

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/output-format.md""

## Node options

Use the options to create a message to send to the agent at the start of the conversation. The message type depends on the model you're using:

* **Chat models**: These models have the concept of three components interacting (AI, system, and human). They can receive system messages and human messages (prompts).
* **Instruct models**: These models don't have the concept of separate AI, system, and human components. They receive one body of text, the instruct message.

### Human Message Template

Use this option to extend the user prompt. This is a way for the agent to pass information from one iteration to the next.

Available LangChain expressions:

* `{input}`: Contains the user prompt.
* `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

### Prefix Message

Enter text to prefix the tools list at the start of the conversation. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Suffix Message for Chat Model

Add text to append after the tools list at the start of the conversation when the agent uses a chat model. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Suffix Message for Regular Model

Add text to append after the tools list at the start of the conversation when the agent uses a regular/instruct model. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

///

### Prompt

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/prompt.md""

## Node options

Refine the SQL Agent node's behavior using these options:

### Ignored Tables

If you'd like the node to ignore any tables from the database, enter a comma-separated list of tables you'd like it to ignore.

If left empty, the agent doesn't ignore any tables.

### Include Sample Rows

Enter the number of sample rows to include in the prompt to the agent. Default is `3`.

Sample rows help the agent understand the schema of the database, but they also increase the number of tokens used.

### Included Tables

If you'd only like to include specific tables from the database, enter a comma-separated list of tables to include.

If left empty, the agent includes all tables.

### Prefix Prompt

Enter a message you'd like to send to the agent before the **Prompt** text. This initial message can provide more context and guidance to the agent about what it can and can't do, and how to format the response.

n8n fills this field with an example.

### Suffix Prompt

Enter a message you'd like to send to the agent after the **Prompt** text.

Available LangChain expressions:

* `{chatHistory}`: A history of messages in this conversation, useful for maintaining context.
* `{input}`: Contains the user prompt.
* `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

n8n fills this field with an example.

### Limit

Enter the maximum number of results to return.

Default is `10`.

# Tools AI Agent node

The Tools Agent uses external tools and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task. This agent helps integrate LLMs with various external services and databases.

This agent has an enhanced ability to work with tools and can ensure a standard output format.

The Tools Agent implements [Langchain's tool calling](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/){:target=_blank .external-link} interface. This interface describes available tools and their schemas. The agent also has improved output parsing capabilities, as it passes the parser to the model as a formatting tool.

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index/) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

# Question and Answer Chain node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Question and Answer Chain node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## No prompt specified error

This error displays when the **Prompt** is empty or invalid.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
    * To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.
    * Make sure any expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Take from previous node automatically** and the incoming data has null values.
    * To resolve, make sure your input contains a `chatInput` field. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.
    * Remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

<!-- vale from-write-good.Passive = NO -->
## A Retriever sub-node must be connected error
<!-- vale from-write-good.Passive = YES -->

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Retriever connected.

To resolve this, click the + Retriever button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Retriever + connector when the node isn't open. n8n will then open a selection of possible Retrievers to pick from.

## Can't produce longer responses

If you need to generate longer responses than the Question and Answer Chain node produces by default, you can try one or more of the following techniques:

* **Connect a more verbose model**: Some AI models produce more terse results than others. Swapping your model for one with a larger context window and more verbose output can increase the word length of your responses.
* **Increase the maximum number of tokens**: Many model nodes (for example the [OpenAI Chat Model](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/#maximum-number-of-tokens)) include a **Maximum Number of Tokens** option. You can set this to increase the maximum number of tokens the model can use to produce a response.
* **Build larger responses in stages**: For more detailed answers, you may want to construct replies in stages using a variety of AI nodes. You can use AI split up a single question into multiple prompts and create responses for each. You can then compose a final reply by combining the responses again. Though the details are different, you can find a good example of the general idea in this [template for writing a WordPress post with AI](https://n8n.io/workflows/2187-write-a-wordpress-post-with-ai-starting-from-a-few-keywords/)."

Set to **Automatically Detect by MIME Type** if you want n8n to set the data format for you. If you set a specific data format and the incoming file MIME type doesn't match it, the node errors. If you use **Automatically Detect by MIME Type**, the node falls back to text format if it can't match the file MIME type to a supported data format.
* **Mode**: Displays when you set **Type of Data** to **JSON**. Choose from:
	* **Load All Input Data**: Use all the node's input data.
	* **Load Specific Data**: Use [expressions](/code/expressions/) to define the data you want to load. You can add text as well as expressions. This means you can create a custom document from a mix of text and expressions.

## Node options

* **Metadata**: Set the metadata that should accompany the document in the vector store. This is what you match to using the **Metadata Filter** option when retrieving data using the vector store nodes.

# Ollama Chat Model node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Chat Model node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatollama/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The Ollama Chat Model node is a sub-node. Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance

The Ollama Chat Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance.

To use the Ollama Chat Model, follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker

The Ollama Chat Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

```shell
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

<!-- vale from-microsoft.HeadingColons = NO -->
## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434
<!-- vale from-microsoft.HeadingColons = YES -->

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`."

## Node parameters

### Model

Select the model to use to generate the completion.

n8n dynamically loads models from OpenAI and you'll only see the models available to your account.

## Node options

Use these options to further refine the node's behavior.

### Base URL

Enter a URL here to override the default URL for the API.

### Frequency Penalty

Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.

### Maximum Number of Tokens

Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.

### Response Format

Choose **Text** or **JSON**. **JSON** ensures the model returns valid JSON.

### Presence Penalty

Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.

### Sampling Temperature

Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

### Timeout

Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.

### Max Retries

Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.

### Top P

Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

# Ollama Model node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Model node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmollama/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The Ollama Model node is a sub-node. Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance

The Ollama Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance.

To use the Ollama Model, follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker

The Ollama Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

```shell
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

<!-- vale from-microsoft.HeadingColons = NO -->
## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434
<!-- vale from-microsoft.HeadingColons = YES -->

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`."

# Window Buffer Memory node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Window Buffer Memory node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Single memory instance

If you add more than one Window Buffer Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## Managing the Session ID

In most cases, the `sessionId` is automatically retrieved from the **On Chat Message** trigger. But you may run into an error with the phrase `No sessionId`.

If you have this error, first check the output of your Chat trigger to ensure it includes a `sessionId`.

If you're not using the **On Chat Message** trigger, you'll need to manage sessions manually.

For testing purposes, you can use a static key like `my_test_session`. If you use this approach, be sure to set up proper session management before activating the workflow to avoid potential issues in a live environment."

# Structured Output Parser node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Structured Output Parser node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The OpenAI Chat Model node is a sub-node. Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Adding the structured output parser node to AI nodes

You can attach output parser nodes to select [AI root nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/).

To add the Structured Output Parser to a node, enable the **Require Specific Output Format** option in the AI root node you wish to format. Once the option is enabled, a new **output parser** attachment point is displayed. Click the **output parser** attachment point to add the Structured Output Parser node to the node.

## Using the structured output parser to format intermediary steps

The Structured Output Parser node structures the final output from AI agents. It's not intended to structure intermediary output to pass to other AI tools or stages.

To request a specific format for intermediary output, include the response structure in the **System Message** for the **AI Agent**. The message can include either a schema or example response for the agent to use as a template for its results."

# Aggregate

Use the Aggregate node to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.

## Node parameters

To begin using the node, select the **Aggregate** you'd like to use:

* [**Individual Fields**](#individual-fields): Aggregate individual fields separately.
* [**All Item Data**](#all-item-data): Aggregate all item data into a single list.

### Individual Fields

* **Input Field Name**: Enter the name of the field in the input data to aggregate together.
* **Rename Field**: This toggle controls whether to give the field a different name in the aggregated output data. Turn this on to add a different field name. If you're aggregating multiple fields, you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.
	* **Output Field Name**: This field is displayed when you turn on **Rename Field**. Enter the field name for the aggregated output data.

Refer to [Node options](#node-options) for more configuration options.

### All Item Data

* **Put Output in Field**: Enter the name of the field to output the data in.
* **Include**: Select which fields to include in the output. Choose from:
	* **All fields**: The output includes data from all fields with no further parameters.
	* **Specified Fields**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should include data from in the **Fields To Include** parameter. The output will include only the fields in this list.
	* **All Fields Except**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should exclude data from in the **Fields To Exclude** parameter. The output will include all fields not in this list.

Refer to [Node options](#node-options) for more configuration options.

## Node options

You can further configure this node using these **Options**:

* **Disable Dot Notation**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. It controls whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on), or allow it (turned off, default).
* **Merge Lists**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on if the field to aggregate is a list and you want to output a single flat list rather than a list of lists.
* **Include Binaries**: The node displays this toggle for both Aggregate types. Turn it on if you want to include binary data from the input in the new output.
* **Keep Missing And Null Values**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on to add a null (empty) entry in the output list when there is a null or missing value in the input. If turned off, the output ignores null or empty values.

# Compare Datasets

The Compare Datasets node helps you compare data from two input streams.

## Node parameters

1. Decide which fields to compare. In **Input A Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In **Input B Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B. 
2. **Optional**: You can compare by multiple fields. Select **Add Fields to Match** to set up more comparisons.
3. Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In **When There Are Differences**, select one of the following:
	* **Use Input A Version** to treat input stream A as the source of truth.
	* **Use Input B Version** to treat input stream B as the source of truth.
	* **Use a Mix of Versions** to use different inputs for different fields.
		* Use **Prefer** to select either **Input A Version** or **Input B Version** as the main source of truth.
		* Enter input fields that are exceptions to **For Everything Except** to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.
	* **Include Both Versions** to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.
4. Decide whether to use **Fuzzy Compare**. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string `3` are treated as the same with **Fuzzy Compare** turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.

## Understand item comparison

Item comparison is a two stage process:

1. n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.
2. If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.

## Node options

Use the node **Options** to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.

### Fields to Skip Comparing

Enter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.

For example, if you compare the two datasets below using `person.language` as the **Fields to Match**, n8n returns them as different. If you add `person.name` to **Fields to Skip Comparing**, n8n returns them as matching.

```json
	// Input 1
	[
		{
			""person"":
			{
				""name"":	""Stefan"",
				""language"":	""de""
			}
		},
		{
			""person"":
			{
				""name"":	""Jim"",
				""language"":	""en""
			}
		},
		{
			""person"":
			{
				""name"":	""Hans"",
				""language"":	""de""
			}
		}
	]
	// Input 2
		[
		{
			""person"":
			{
				""name"":	""Sara"",
				""language"":	""de""
			}
		},
		{
			""person"":
			{
				""name"":	""Jane"",
				""language"":	""en""
			}
		},
		{
			""person"":
			{
				""name"":	""Harriet"",
				""language"":	""de""
			}
		}
	]
```

### Disable Dot Notation

Whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on) or allow it (turned off, default).

### Multiple Matches

Choose how to handle duplicate data. The default is **Include All Matches**. You can choose **Include First Match Only**.

For example, given these two datasets:
```json
	// Input 1
	[
		{
			""fruit"": {
				""type"": ""apple"",
				""color"": ""red""
			}
		},
				{
			""fruit"": {
				""type"": ""apple"",
				""color"": ""red""
			}
		},
				{
			""fruit"": {
				""type"": ""banana"",
				""color"": ""yellow""
			}
		}
	]
	// Input 2
	[
		{
			""fruit"": {
				""type"": ""apple"",
				""color"": ""red""
			}
		},
				{
			""fruit"": {
				""type"": ""apple"",
				""color"": ""red""
			}
		},
				{
			""fruit"": {
				""type"": ""banana"",
				""color"": ""yellow""
			}
		}
	]
```

n8n returns three items in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches.

If you select **Include First Match Only**, n8n returns two items, in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches, but n8n only returns the first occurrence of the matching ""apple"" items.


## Understand the output

There are four output options:

* **In A only Branch**: Contains data that occurs only in the first input.
* **Same Branch**: Contains data that's the same in both inputs.
* **Different Branch**: Contains data that's different between inputs.

# Error Trigger node

You can use the Error Trigger node to create error workflows. When another linked workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the errors, and runs the error workflow.

## Usage

--8<-- ""_snippets/flow-logic/create-set-error-workflow.md""


Note the following:

* If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
* If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
* You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error Trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.

## Templates and examples

# Execute Workflow Trigger node

Use this node to start a workflow in response to another workflow. It should be the first node in the workflow.

n8n allows you to call workflows from other workflows. This is useful if you want to:

* Reuse a workflow: for example, you could have multiple workflows pulling and processing data from different sources, then have all those workflows call a single workflow that generates a report.
* Break large workflows into smaller components.

## Usage

This node runs in response to a call from the [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node.

# n8n Form node

Use the n8n Form node to create user-facing forms with multiple steps. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. You must start the workflow with the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/).

[[ workflowDemo(""file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json"") ]]

## Setting up the node

### Set default selections with query parameters

You can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms){:target=_blank .external-link} with the initial URL provided by the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). Every page in the form receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.

/// note | Only for production
Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.
///

<!-- vale from-microsoft.Percentages = NO -->
When using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding){:target=_blank .external-link} any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.

As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:

* Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`
* Fields:
	* `name`: `Jane Doe`
	* `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`

With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:

```
https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe
```

Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character (` `) with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.
<!-- vale from-microsoft.Percentages = YES -->

### Defining the form using JSON

Use **Define Form** > **Using JSON** to define the fields of your form with a [JSON array of objects](/data/data-structure). Each object defines a single field by using a combination of these keys:

- `fieldLabel`: The label that appears above the input field. 
- `fieldType`: Choose from `date`, `dropdown`, `email`, `file`, `number`, `password`, `text`, or `textarea`.
    - Use `date` to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.
	- When using `dropdown`, set the choices with `fieldOptions` (reference the example below). By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, set `multiselect` to `true`.
	- When using `file`, set `multipleFiles` to `true` to allow users to select more than one file. To define the file types to allow, set `acceptFileTypes` to a string containing a comma-separated list of file extensions (reference the example below).
- `placeholder`: Specify placeholder data for the field. You can use this for every `fieldType` except `dropdown`, `date`, and `file`.
- `requiredField`: Require users to complete this field on the form.

An example JSON that shows the general format required and the keys available:

```javascript
// Use the ""requiredField"" key on any field to mark it as mandatory
// Use the ""placeholder"" key to specify placeholder data for all fields
//     except 'dropdown', 'date' and 'file'

[
	{
		""fieldLabel"": ""Date Field"",
		""fieldType"": ""date"",
		""formatDate"": ""mm/dd/yyyy"", // how to format received date in n8n
		""requiredField"": true
	},
	{
		""fieldLabel"": ""Dropdown Options"",
		""fieldType"": ""dropdown"",
		""fieldOptions"": {
			""values"": [
				{
					""option"": ""option 1""
				},
				{
					""option"": ""option 2""
				}
			]
		},
		""requiredField"": true
	},
	{
		""fieldLabel"": ""Multiselect"",
		""fieldType"": ""dropdown"",
		""fieldOptions"": {
			""values"": [
				{
					""option"": ""option 1""
				},
				{
					""option"": ""option 2""
				}
			]
		},
		""multiselect"": true // setting to true allows multi-select
	},
	{
		""fieldLabel"": ""Email"",
		""fieldType"": ""email"",
		""placeholder"": ""me@mail.con""
	},
	{
		""fieldLabel"": ""File"",
		""fieldType"": ""file"",
		""multipleFiles"": true, // setting to true allows multiple files selection
		""acceptFileTypes"": "".jpg, .png"" // allowed file types
	},
	{
		""fieldLabel"": ""Number"",
		""fieldType"": ""number""
	},
	{
		""fieldLabel"": ""Password"",
		""fieldType"": ""password""
	},
	{
		// ""fieldType"": ""text"" can be omitted since it's the default type
		""fieldLabel"": ""Text""
	},
	{
		""fieldLabel"": ""Textarea"",
		""fieldType"": ""textarea""
	}
]
```

### Form Ending

Use the **Form Ending** Page Type to end a form and either show a completion page or redirect the user to a URL. Only one Form Ending page is displayed per execution, even when n8n executes [multiple branches](#forms-with-branches) that contain Form Ending nodes.

Choose between these options when using **On n8n Form Submission**:

- **Show Completion Screen**: Shows users a final screen to confirm that they submitted the form.
	- Fill in **Completion Title** to set the `h1` title on the form.
	- n8n displays the **Completion Message** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break. 
	- Select **Add option** and fill in **Completion Page Title** to set the page's title in the browser tab.

When using **Redirect to URL**, fill in the **URL** field with the page you want to redirect to when users complete the form.

### Forms with branches

The n8n Form node executes and displays its associated form page whenever it receives data from a previous node. When building forms with n8n, to avoid confusion, it's important to understand how forms behave when branching occurs.

#### Workflows with mutually exclusive branches

Form workflows containing mutually exclusive branches work as expected. n8n will execute a single branch according to the submitted data and conditions you outline. As it executes, n8n will display each page in the branch, ending with an n8n Form node with the **Form Ending** page type.

This workflow demonstrates mutually exclusive branching. Each selection can only execute a single branch.

[[ workflowDemo(""file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json"") ]]

#### Workflows that may execute multiple branches

Form workflows that send data to multiple branches at the same time require more care. When multiple branches receive data during an execution (for example, from a [switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) node), n8n executes each branch that receives data [sequentially](/flow-logic/execution-order/). Upon reaching the end of one branch, the execution will move to the next branch with data.

n8n only executes a single **Form Ending** n8n Form node for each execution. When multiple branches of a form workflow receive data, n8n ignores all Form Ending nodes except for the one associated with the final branch.

This workflow may execute more than one branch during an execution. Here, n8n executes all valid branches sequentially. This impacts which n8n Form nodes n8n executes (in particular, which **Form Ending** node displays):

[[ workflowDemo(""file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/multiple-branch-execution.json"") ]]

### Node options

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options: 

- **Form Title**: The title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.
- **Form Description**: The description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break. 
- **Button Label**: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the **Button Label** as the name of the submit button.

## Running the node

### Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL** in the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. 

There are two ways to test:

- Select **Test Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node and any previous nodes, but not the rest of the workflow.
- Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.

### Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the n8n Form Trigger's **Production URL** by opening the trigger node and selecting the **Production URL** in the **From URLS** selector. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

- Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.

## Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production URL**. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

## Set default selections with query parameters

You can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms){:target=_blank .external-link} with the initial URL provided by the n8n Form Trigger. Every [page in the form](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/) receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.

/// note | Only for production
Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.
///

<!-- vale from-microsoft.Percentages = NO -->
When using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding){:target=_blank .external-link} any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.

As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:

* Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`
* Fields:
	* `name`: `Jane Doe`
	* `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`

With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:

```
https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe
```

Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character (` `) with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.
<!-- vale from-microsoft.Percentages = YES -->

## Node parameters

These are the main node configuration fields:

### Authentication

- **Basic Auth**
- **None**

#### Using basic auth

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting.
- The **Password** that goes with that username.

### Form URLs

The Form Trigger node has two URLs: **Test URL** and **Production URL**. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

![Screenshot of the form URLs](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/form-trigger/form-urls.png)

- **Test URL**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Test Step** or **Test Workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
- **Production URL**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution. Select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### Form Path

Set a custom slug for the form.

### Form Title

Enter the title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.

### Form Description

Enter the description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break. 

### Form Fields

Create the question fields for your form. Select **Add Form Field** to add a new field.

Every field has the following settings:

- **Field Label**: Enter the label that appears above the input field. 
- **Field Type**: Choose from **Date**, **Dropdown List**, **Email**, **File**, **Number**, **Password**, **Text**, or **Textarea**.
    - Select **Date** to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.
	- Select **Dropdown List** > **Add Field Option** to add multiple options. By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, turn on **Multiple Choice**. 
- **Required Field**: Turn on to require users to complete this field on the form. 

### Respond When

Choose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when:

- **Form Is Submitted**: Send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form.
- **Workflow Finishes**: Use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options: 

- **Append n8n Attribution**: Turn off to hide the **Form automated with n8n** attribute at the bottom of the form.
- **Form Response**: Choose how to respond when the user submits the form. 
    - **Respond With** > **Form Submitted Text**: Show a message to the user.
    - **Respond With** > **Redirect URL**: Send the user to a new page.
- **Ignore Bots**: Turn on to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers. 
- **Use Workflow Timezone**: Turn on to use the timezone in the [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings/) instead of UTC (default). This affects the value of the `submittedAt` timestamp in the node output.

# Item Lists

/// warning | Removed in 1.21.0
n8n removed the Item Lists node in version 1.21.0. Use the following nodes instead:

* [Aggregate](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
* [Limit](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
* [Remove Duplicates](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
* [Sort](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
* [Split Out](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
* [Summarize](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables. 
///

The Item Lists node simplifies working with returned data that contain lists (arrays), enabling you to change the structure for further processing without the need to use [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) nodes or write custom JavaScript.

## Operations

The Item Lists node enables you to perform the following operations:

* Concatenate Items: merge multiple items into a single new item.
* Limit: remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
* Remove Duplicates: remove extraneous items.
* Sort: change the ordering of items.
* Split Out Items: create separate items from a list of data within an item.
* Summarize: aggregate items together. Similar to a pivot table.

### Split Out Items

This operation is useful if your data contains a list of items, for example a list of customers, and you want to split them so that you have an item for each customer.

When using the Split Out Items operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Field to Split Out**: the field containing the list you want to separate out into individual items.
	* If working with file inputs, use `$binary` in an expression to set the field to split out.
* **Include**: select if  you want n8n to keep any other fields from the input data with each new individual item. You can select:
    * **No Other Fields**
    * **All Other Fields**
    * **Selected Other Fields**: when selected, n8n displays **Fields to Include**. Enter a comma separated list of desired fields.
	* **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:
		* **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).	
		* **Destination Field Name**: optionally set the field name under which to put the new split contents.
		* **Include Binary**: include binary data (files) from the input in the new output.

### Concatenate Items

The Concatenate Items operations is useful when you want to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.

When using the Concatenate Items operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Aggregate**: choose whether to aggregate **Individual Fields** or **All Item Data**.
* If you choose **Individual Fields**, you can then set:
	* **Field To Aggregate**: the name of the field in the input data to be aggregated together.
	* **Rename Field**: enable this toggle to enter a field name for the aggregated output data. When aggregating multiple fields you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.
	* **Output Field Name**: displayed when you enable **Rename Field**. The field name for the aggregated output data.
	* **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:
		* **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).
		* **Include Binaries**: include binary data (files) from the input in the new output.
* If you choose **All Item Data**, you can then set:
	* **Put Output in Field**: the name of the output field.
	* **Include**: choose from **All fields**, **Specified Fields**, or **All Fields Except**.


### Remove Duplicates

There are situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items. 

The Remove Duplicates operation allows you to identify those items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.

When using the Remove Duplicates operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Compare**: specify which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:
  * **All Fields**: compares all fields of the input data.
  * **All Fields Except**: enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.
  * **Selected Fields**: enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.
* If you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields**, n8n displays **Options** > **Add Field**. Use this to add more optional settings, including:
	* **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).

### Sort

The Sort operation allows you to organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.

/// note | Array sort behavior
The Sort operation uses the default JavaScript operation where the elements to be sorted are converted into strings and their values compared. Refer to [Mozilla's guide to Array sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort){:target=_blank .external-link} to learn more.
///


When using the Sort operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Type**: use the dropdown to select how you want to input the sorting. The following options are available:
  * **Simple**: when you selected, you can use the **Add Field To Sort By** button to input the fields, and select whether to use **Ascending** or **Descending** order.
  * **Random**: select to create a random order in the list.
  * **Code**: when selected, displays a code input field where you can enter custom JavaScript code to perform the sort operation.
* **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:
	* **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).

### Limit

If you want to keep and process a specific number of items from your incoming data, the Limit operation allows you to select the number of items to keep and whether n8n should take them from the beginning or end of the data.

When using the Limit operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Max Items**: enter the maximum number of items that n8n should keep. If the input data contains more than this value, n8n removes the items.
* **Keep**: when items must be removed, select if n8n keeps the input items at the beginning or end.

### Summarize

Aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

When using the Summarize operation, configure the following parameters and options:

* **Fields to Summarize**: 
	* To combine values, select an **Aggregation** method, and enter a **Field** name.
	* To split values, enter a field name or list of names in **Fields to Split By**.
* **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:
	* **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).
	* **Each Split in a Separate Item**: splitting generates a separate output item for each split out field.
	* **All Splits in a Single Item**: splitting generates a single item, which lists the split out fields.

# Local File Trigger node

The Local File Trigger node starts a workflow when it detects changes on the file system. These changes involve a file or folder getting added, changed, or deleted.

/// note | Self-hosted n8n only
This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.
///

## Node parameters

You can choose what event to watch for using the **Trigger On** parameter.

## Changes to a Specific File

The node triggers when the specified file changes.

Enter the path for the file to watch in **File to Watch**.

## Changes Involving a Specific Folder

The node triggers when a change occurs in the selected folder.

Configure these parameters:

- **Folder to Watch**: Enter the path of the folder to watch.
- **Watch for**: Select the type of change to watch for.


## Node options

Use the node **Options** to include or exclude files and folders.

- **Include Linked Files/Folders**: also watch for changes to linked files or folders.
- **Ignore**: files or paths to ignore. n8n tests the whole path, not just the filename. Supports the [Anymatch](https://github.com/micromatch/anymatch){:target=_blank .external-link} syntax.
- **Max Folder Depth**: how deep into the folder structure to watch for changes.

### Examples for Ignore

Ignore a single file:

```sh
**/<fileName>.<suffix>
# For example, **/myfile.txt
```

Ignore a sub-directory of a directory you're watching:

```sh
**/<directoryName>/**
# For example, **/myDirectory/**
```

# Manual Trigger node

Use this node if you want to start a workflow by selecting **Test Workflow** and don't want any option for the workflow to run automatically.

Workflows always need a trigger, or start point. Most workflows start with a trigger node firing in response to an external event or the [Schedule Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) firing on a set schedule.

The Manual Trigger node serves as the workflow trigger for workflows that don't have an automatic trigger.

Use this trigger:

* To test your workflow before you add an automatic trigger of some kind.
* When you don't want the workflow to run automatically.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Manual Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

<!-- vale off -->
### Only one 'Manual Trigger' node is allowed in a workflow
<!-- vale on -->

This error displays if you try to add a Manual Trigger node to a workflow which already includes a Manual Trigger node.

Remove your existing Manual Trigger or edit your workflow to connect that trigger to a different node."

# Merge

Use the Merge node to combine data from multiple streams, once data of all streams is available.

/// note | Major changes in 0.194.0
The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 0.194.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/4ff688642cc9ee7ca7d00987847bf4e4515da59d/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md){:target=_blank .external-link}.
///

/// note | Minor changes in 1.49.0
n8n version 1.49.0 introduced the option to add more than two inputs. Older versions only support up to two inputs. If you're running an older version and want to combine multiple inputs in these versions, use the [Code node](https://deploy-preview-2225--n8n-docs.netlify.app/code/code-node/).

The **Mode > SQL Query** feature was also added in n8n version 1.49.0 and isn't available in older versions.
///

## Node parameters

You can specify how the Merge node should combine data from different data streams by choosing a **Mode**: 

### Append

Keep data from all inputs. Choose a **Number of Inputs** to output items of each input, one after another. The node waits for the execution of all connected inputs. 

<figure markdown=""span"">
![Sample Append mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left, one with items A, B, C and one with items D, E, F. The final data source combines both and lists A, B, C, D, E, F.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/append-diagram.png)
<figcaption>Append mode inputs and output</figcaption>
</figure>

### Combine

Combine data from two inputs. Select an option in **Combine By** to determine how you want to merge the input data.

#### Matching Fields

Compare items by field values. Enter the fields you want to compare in **Fields to Match**. 

n8n's default behavior is to keep matching items. You can change this using the **Output Type** setting:

* **Keep Matches**: Merge items that match. This is like an inner join.
* **Keep Non-Matches**: Merge items that don't match.
* **Keep Everything**: Merge items together that do match and include items that don't match. This is like an outer join.
* **Enrich Input 1**: Keep all data from Input 1, and add matching data from Input 2. This is like a left join.
* **Enrich Input 2**: Keep all data from Input 2, and add matching data from Input 1. This is like a right join.

<figcaption>Combine by Matching Fields mode inputs and output</figcaption>
</figure>


#### Position

Combine items based on their order. The item at index 0 in Input 1 merges with the item at index 0 in Input 2, and so on.

When merging data by **Mode > Combine**, you can set these **Options**:

* **Clash Handling**: Choose how to merge when data streams clash, or when there are sub-fields. Refer to [Clash handling](#clash-handling) for details.
* **Fuzzy Compare**: Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats `""3""` and `3` as the same.
* **Disable Dot Notation**: This prevents accessing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name.
* **Multiple Matches**: Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams.
    * **Include All Matches**: Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match.
    * **Include First Match Only**: Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches.
* **Include Any Unpaired Items**: Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match. 

##### Clash Handling

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/field-value-clash.md""

### SQL Query

Write a custom SQL Query to merge the data. 

Example: 
```sql
SELECT * FROM input1 LEFT JOIN input2 ON input1.name = input2.id
```

Data from previous nodes are available as tables and you can use them in the SQL query as input1, input2, input3, and so on, based on their order. Refer to [AlaSQL GitHub page](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Supported-SQL-statements){:target=_blank .external-link} for a full list of supported SQL statements. 

### Choose Branch

Choose which input to keep. This option always waits until the data from both inputs is available. You can choose to **Output**:

* The **Input 1 Data**
* The **Input 2 Data**
* **A Single, Empty Item**

The node outputs the data from the chosen input, without changing it.

## Templates and examples

<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->
[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'merge') ]]

## Merging data streams with uneven numbers of items

The items passed into Input 1 of the Merge node will take precedence. For example, if the Merge node receives five items in Input 1 and 10 items in Input 2, it only processes five items. The remaining five items from Input 2 aren't processed.

## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/if-merge-branch-execution.md""


## Try it out: A step by step example

Create a workflow with some example input data to try out the Merge node.

### Set up sample data using the Code nodes

1. Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Start node.
2. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:
```js
return [
  {
    json: {
      name: 'Stefan',
      language: 'de',
    }
  },
  {
    json: {
      name: 'Jim',
      language: 'en',
    }
  },
  {
    json: {
      name: 'Hans',
      language: 'de',
    }
  }
];
```
3. Add a second Code node, and connect it to the Start node.
4. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:
```js
return [
	  {
    json: {
      greeting: 'Hello',
      language: 'en',
    }
  },
  {
    json: {
      greeting: 'Hallo',
      language: 'de',
    }
  }
];
```

### Try out different merge modes

Add the Merge node. Connect the first Code node to **Input 1**, and the second Code node to **Input 2**. Run the workflow to load data into the Merge node.

The final workflow should look like this:

[[ workflowDemo(""https://api.n8n.io/workflows/templates/655"") ]]

Now try different options in **Mode** to see how it affects the output data.

#### Append

Select **Mode** > **Append**, then select **Test step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:
<!-- vale off -->
| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | de |  |
| Jim | en |  |
| Hans | de |  |
|   | en | Hello |
|   | de | Hallo |
<!-- vale on -->

#### Combine by Matching Fields

You can merge these two data inputs so that each person gets the correct greeting for their language.

1. Select **Mode** > **Combine**.
2. Select **Combine by** > **Matching Fields**.
3. In both **Input 1 Field** and **Input 2 Field**, enter `language`. This tells n8n to combine the data by matching the values in the `language` field in each data set.
4. Select **Test step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:
<!-- vale off -->

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | de | Hallo |
| Jim | en | Hello  |
| Hans | de | Hallo |
<!-- vale on -->

#### Combine by Position

Select **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **Position**, then select **Test step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:
<!-- vale off -->
| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | en | Hello |
| Jim | de | Hallo  |
<!-- vale on -->

##### Keep unpaired items

If you want to keep all items, select **Add Option** > **Include Any Unpaired Items**, then turn on **Include Any Unpaired Items**.

Your output in table view should look like this:
<!-- vale off -->
| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | en | Hello |
| Jim | de | Hallo  |
| Hans | de |  |
<!-- vale on -->

#### Combine by All Possible Combinations 

Select **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **All Possible Combinations**, then select **Test step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:
<!-- vale off -->
| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | en | Hello |
| Stefan | de | Hallo |
| Jim | en | Hello  |
| Jim | de | Hallo |
| Hans | en | Hello |
| Hans | de | Hallo |
<!-- vale on -->"

# Respond to Webhook

Use the Respond to Webhook node to control the response to incoming webhooks. This node works with the [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.

/// note | Runs once for the first data item
The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. Refer to [Return more than one data item](#return-more-than-one-data-item) for more information.
///

## How to use Respond to Webhook

To use the Respond to Webhook node:

1. Add a [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node as the trigger node for the workflow.
1. In the Webhook node, set **Respond** to **Using 'Respond to Webhook' node**.
1. Add the Respond to Webhook node anywhere in your workflow. If you want it to return data from other nodes, place it after those nodes.

## Node parameters

Configure the node behavior using these parameters.

### Respond With

Choose what data to send in the webhook response.

- **All Incoming Items**: Respond with all the JSON items from the input.
- **Binary**: Respond with a binary file defined in **Response Data Source**.
- **First Incoming Item**: Respond with the first incoming item's JSON.
- **JSON**: Respond with a JSON object defined in **Response Body**.
- **No Data**: No response payload.
- **Redirect**: Redirect to a URL set in **Redirect URL**.
- **Text**: Respond with text set in **Response Body**.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view and set the options.

- **Response Code**: Set the [response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status){:target=_blank .external-link} to use.
- **Response Headers**: Define the response headers to send.
- **Put Response in Field**: Available when you respond with **All Incoming Items** or **First Incoming Item**. Set the field name for the field containing the response data.

## Templates and examples

<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->
[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'respond-to-webhook') ]]

## Workflow behavior

When using the Respond to Webhook node, workflows behave as follows:

- The workflow finishes without executing the Respond to Webhook node: it returns a standard message with a 200 status.
- The workflow errors before the first Respond to Webhook node executes: the workflow returns an error message with a 500 status.
- A second Respond to Webhook node executes after the first one: the workflow ignores it.
- A Respond to Webhook node executes but there was no webhook: the workflow ignores the Respond to Webhook node.

## Return more than one data item (deprecated)

/// note | Deprecated in 1.22.0
n8n 1.22.0 added support for returning all data items using the **All Incoming Items** option. n8n recommends upgrading to the latest version of n8n, instead of using the workarounds described in this section.
///

The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. This includes when using [expressions](/code/expressions/). You can't force looping using the Loop node: the workflow will run, but the webhook response will still only contain the results of the first execution. 

If you need to return more than one data item, choose one of these options:

- Instead of using the Respond to Webhook node, use the **When Last Node Finishes** option in **Respond** in the Webhook node. Use this when you want to return the final data that the workflow outputs.
- Use the [Aggregate](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) node to turn multiple items into a single item before passing the data to the Respond to Webhook node. Set **Aggregate** to **All Item Data (Into a Single List)**."

# Edit Fields (Set)

Use the Edit Fields node to set workflow data. This node can set new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values to Google Sheets or databases.

## Node parameters

The are the settings and options available in the Edit Fields node.

### Mode

You can either use **Manual Mapping** to edit fields using the GUI or **JSON Output** to write JSON that n8n adds to the input data.

### Fields to Set

If you select **Mode** > **Manual Mapping**, you can configure the fields by dragging and dropping values from **INPUT**.

The default behavior when you drag a value is:

* n8n sets the value's name as the field name.
* The field value contains an expression which accesses the value.

If you don't want to use expressions:

1. Hover over a field. n8n displays the **Fixed | Expressions** toggle. 
1. Select **Fixed**.

You can do this for both the name and value of the field.

![A gif showing the drag and drop action, as well as changing a field to fixed](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/set/drag-drop-fixed-toggle.gif)

### Keep Only Set Fields

Enable this to discard any input data that you don't use in **Fields to Set**.

### Include in Output

Choose which input data to include in the node's output data.

## Node options

Use these options to customize the behavior of the node.

### Include Binary Data

If the input data includes binary data, choose whether to include it in the Edit Fields node's output data.

### Ignore Type Conversion Errors

Manual Mapping only.

Enabling this allows n8n to ignore some data type errors when mapping fields.

### Support Dot Notation

By default, n8n supports dot notation.

For example, when using manual mapping, the node follows the dot notation for the **Name** field. That means if you set the name in the **Name** field as `number.one` and the value in the **Value** field as `20`, the resulting JSON is:

```json
{ ""number"": { ""one"": 20} }
```

You can prevent this behavior by selecting **Add Option** > **Support Dot Notation**, and setting the **Dot Notion** field to off. Now the resulting JSON is:

```json
{ ""number.one"": 20 }
```

[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'set') ]]

## Arrays and expressions in JSON Output mode

You can use arrays and expressions when creating your JSON Output.

For example, given this input data generated by the Customer Datastore node:

```json
[
  {
    ""id"": ""23423532"",
    ""name"": ""Jay Gatsby"",
    ""email"": ""gatsby@west-egg.com"",
    ""notes"": ""Keeps asking about a green light??"",
    ""country"": ""US"",
    ""created"": ""1925-04-10""
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423533"",
    ""name"": ""José Arcadio Buendía"",
    ""email"": ""jab@macondo.co"",
    ""notes"": ""Lots of people named after him. Very confusing"",
    ""country"": ""CO"",
    ""created"": ""1967-05-05""
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423534"",
    ""name"": ""Max Sendak"",

    ""notes"": ""Passionate sailor"",
    ""country"": ""UK"",
    ""created"": ""1950-10-16""
  }
]
```

Add the following JSON in the **JSON Output** field, with **Include in Output** set to **All Input Fields**:

```json
{
  ""newKey"": ""new value"",
  ""array"": [{{ $json.id }},""{{ $json.name }}""],
  ""object"": {
    ""innerKey1"": ""new value"",
    ""innerKey2"": ""{{ $json.id }}"",
    ""innerKey3"": ""{{ $json.name }}"",
 }
}
```

You get this output:

```json

# Sort

Use the Sort node to organize lists of items in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.

/// note | Array sort behavior
The Sort operation uses the default JavaScript operation where the elements to be sorted are converted into strings and their values compared. Refer to [Mozilla's guide to Array sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort){:target=_blank .external-link} to learn more.
///

## Node parameters

Configure this node using the **Type** parameter.

Use the dropdown to select how you want to input the sorting from these options.

### Simple

Performs an ascending or descending sort using the selected fields.

When you select this **Type**:

* Use the **Add Field To Sort By** button to input the **Field Name**.
* Select whether to use **Ascending** or **Descending** order.

#### Simple options

When you select **Simple** as the **Type**, you have the option to **Disable Dot Notation**. By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Random

Creates a random order in the list.

### Code

Input custom JavaScript code to perform the sort operation. This is a good option if a simple sort won't meet your needs.

Enter your custom JavaScript code in the **Code** input field.

# Loop Over Items

The Loop Over Items node helps you loop through data.

The node saves the original incoming data, and with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data through the **loop** output.

When the node execution completes, it combines all the data and returns it through the **done** output.

## Node parameters

### Batch Size

Enter the number of items to return with each call.

## Node options

### Reset

If turned on, the node will reset with the current input-data newly initialized with each loop.

/// note | Check if you need this node
n8n automatically processes incoming items. You may not need the Loop Over Items node in your workflow. To learn more about how n8n handles multiple items, refer to the documentation on [Looping in n8n](/flow-logic/looping/).
///

### Read RSS feed from two different sources

This workflow allows you to read an RSS feed from two different sources using the Loop Over Items node. You need the Loop Over Items node in the workflow as the RSS Feed Read node only processes the first item it receives. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/687-read-rss-feed-from-two-different-sources/){:target=_blank .external-link} on n8n.io.

The example walks through building the workflow, but assumes you are already familiar with n8n. To build your first workflow, including learning how to add nodes to a workflow, refer to [Try it out](/try-it-out/).

The final workflow looks like this:

![A workflow with the Loop Over Items node](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/splitinbatches/workflow.png)

1. Add the manual trigger.
2. Add the Code node.
3. Copy this code into the Code node:
	```js
	return [
		{
			json: {
				url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io',
			}
		},
		{
			json: {
				url: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n',
			}
		}
	];
	```
4. Add the Loop Over Items node.
5. Configure Loop Over Items: set the batch size to `1` in the **Batch Size** field.
6. Add the RSS Feed Read node.
7. Select **Test Workflow**. This runs the workflow to load data into the RSS Feed Read node.
8. Configure RSS Feed Read: map `url` from the input to the **URL** field. You can do this by dragging and dropping from the **INPUT** panel, or using this expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.
9. Select **Test Workflow** to run the workflow and see the resulting data.

### Check that the node has processed all items

To check if the node still has items to process, use the following expression: `{{$node[""Loop Over Items""].context[""noItemsLeft""]}}`. This expression returns a boolean value. If the node still has data to process, the expression returns `false`, otherwise it returns `true`.

### Get the current running index of the node

To get the current running index of the node, use the following expression: `{{$node[""Loop Over Items""].context[""currentRunIndex""];}}`."

You can select:

* **No Other Fields**: No other fields will be included.
* **All Other Fields**: All other fields will be included.
* **Selected Other Fields**: Only the selected fields will be included.
    * **Fields to Include**: Enter a comma separated list of the fields you want to include.

## Node options

### Disable Dot Notation

By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Destination Field Name

Enter the field in the output where the split field contents should go.

### Include Binary

Choose whether to include binary data from the input in the new output (turned on) or not (turned off).

# Summarize

Use the Summarize node to aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

## Node parameters

### Fields to Summarize

Use these fields to define how you want to summarize your input data.

* **Aggregation**: Select the aggregation method to use on a given field. Options include:
	* **Append**: Append 
		* If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
	* **Average**: Calculate the numeric average of your input data.
	* **Concatenate**: Combine together values in your input data.
		* If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
		* **Separator**: Select the separator you want to insert between concatenated values.
	* **Count**: Count the total number of values in your input data.
	* **Count Unique**: Count the number of unique values in your input data.
	* **Max**: Find the highest numeric value in your input data.
	* **Min**: Find the lowest numeric value in your input data.
	* **Sum**: Add together the numeric values in your input data.
* **Field**: Enter the name of the field you want to perform the aggregation on.

### Fields to Split By

Enter the name of the input fields that you want to split the summary by (similar to a group by statement). This allows you to get separate summaries based on values in other fields.

For example, if our input data contains columns for `Sales Rep` and `Deal Amount` and we're performing a **Sum** on the `Deal Amount` field, we could split by `Sales Rep` to get a **Sum** total for each Sales Rep.

To enter multiple fields to split by, enter a comma-separated list.

## Node options

### Continue if Field Not Found

By default, if a **Field to Summarize** isn't in any items, the node throws an error. Use this option to continue and return a single empty item (turned on) instead or keep the default error behavior (turned off).

### Disable Dot Notation

By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Output Format

Select the format for your output format. This option is recommended if you're using **Fields to Split By**

* **Each Split in a Separate Item**: Use this option to generate a separate output item for each split out field.
* **All Splits in a Single Item**: Use this option to generate a single item that lists the split out fields.

## Ignore items without valid fields to group by

Set whether to ignore input items that don't contain the **Fields to Split By** (turned on) or not (turned off).

# Switch

Use the Switch node to route a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations. It's similar to the [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node, but supports multiple output routes.

## Node parameters

Select the **Mode** the node should use:

* **Rules**: Select this mode to build a matching rule for each output.
* **Expression**: Select this mode to write an expression to return the output index programmatically.

Node configuration depends on the **Mode** you select.

### Rules

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

* Create **Routing Rules** to define comparison conditions.
    * Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to create a rules for dates after a particular date, select **Date & Time > is after**.
    * The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to [Available data type comparisons](#available-data-type-comparisons) for a full list of all comparisons by data type.
* **Rename Output**: Turn this control on to rename the output field to put matching data into. Enter your desired **Output Name**.

Select **Add Routing Rule** to add more rules.

#### Rule options

You can further configure the node with this operation using these **Options**:

- **Fallback Output**: Choose how to route the workflow when an item doesn't match any of the rules or conditions.
    - **None**: Ignore the item. This is the default behavior.
    - **Extra Output**: Send items to an extra, separate output.
    - **Output 0**: Send items to the same output as those matching the first rule.
- **Ignore Case**: Set whether to ignore letter case when evaluating conditions (turned on) or enforce letter case (turned off).
- **Less Strict Type Validation**: Set whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Send data to all matching outputs**: Set whether to send data to all outputs meeting conditions (turned on) or whether to send the data to the first output matching the conditions (turned off).

### Expression

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

- **Number of Outputs**: Set how many outputs the node should have.
- **Output Index**: Create an expression to calculate which input item should be routed to which output. The expression must return a number.

# Wait

Use the Wait node pause your workflow's execution. When the workflow pauses it offloads the execution data to the database. When the resume condition is met, the workflow reloads the data and the execution continues.

## Operations

The Wait node can **Resume** on the following conditions:

* [**After Time Interval**](#after-time-interval): The node waits for a certain amount of time.
* [**At Specified Time**](#at-specified-time): The node waits until a specific time.
* [**On Webhook Call**](#on-webhook-call): The node waits until it receives an HTTP call.
* [**On Form Submitted**](#on-form-submitted): The node waits until it receives a form submission.

Refer to the more detailed sections below for more detailed instructions.

### After Time Interval

Wait for a certain amount of time.

This parameter includes two more fields:

* **Wait Amount**: Enter the amount of time to wait.
* **Wait Unit**: Select the unit of measure for the **Wait Amount**. Choose from:
	* **Seconds**
	* **Minutes**
	* **Hours**
	* **Days**

Refer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on how these intervals work and the timezone used.

### At Specified Time

Wait until a specific date and time to continue. Use the date and time picker to set the **Date and Time**.

Refer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on the timezone used.

### On Webhook Call

This parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call.

The webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the `$execution.resumeUrl` variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email. 

When the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the `$execution.resumeUrl`. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.

For this **Resume** style, set more parameters listed below.

#### Authentication

Select if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to `$execution.resumeUrl` should be authenticated. Options include:

* **Basic Auth**: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Basic Auth** to use.
* **Header Auth**: Use header authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Header Auth** to use.
* **JWT Auth**: Use JWT authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for JWT Auth** to use.
* **None**: Don't use authentication.

/// note | Auth reference
Refer to the [Webhook node | Authentication documentation](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#authentication) for more information on each auth type.
///

#### HTTP Method

Select the HTTP method the webhook should use. Refer to the [Webhook node | HTTP Method documentation](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#http-method) for more information.

#### Response Code

Enter the Response Code the webhook should return. You can use common codes or enter a custom code.

#### Respond

Set when and how to respond to the webhook from these options:

* **Immediately**: Respond as soon as the node executes.
* **When Last Node Finishes**: Return the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. If you select this option, also set:
	* **Response Data**: Select what data should be returned and what format to use. Options include:
		* **All Entries**: Returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
		* **First Entry JSON**: Return the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
		* **First Entry Binary**: Return the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
		* **No Response Body**: Return with no body.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

#### Limit Wait Time

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off). If turned on, also set:

* **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:
	* **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.
		* Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.
		* Select the limit's **Unit** of time.
	* **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.
		* **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Webhook Call options

* **Binary Property**: Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. This option's only relevant if binary data is received.
* **Ignore Bots**: Set whether to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers (turned on) or not (turned off).
* **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enter IP addresses here to limit who (or what) can invoke the webhook URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook URL.
* **No Response Body**: Set whether n8n should send a body in the response (turned off) or prevent n8n from sending a body in the response (turned on).
* **Raw Body**: Set whether to return the body in a raw format like JSON or XML (turned on) or not (turned off).
* **Response Data**: Enter any custom data you want to send in the response.
* **Response Headers**: Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header){:target=_blank .external-link} to learn more about response headers.
* **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

#### On Webhook Call limitations

There are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call:

* Partial executions of your workflow changes the `$resumeWebhookUrl`, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node.

### On Form Submitted

Wait for a form submission before continuing. Set up these parameters:

#### Form Title

Enter the title to display at the top of the form.

#### Form Description

Enter a form description to display beneath the title. This description can help prompt the user on how to complete the form.

#### Form Fields

Set up each field you want to appear on your form using these parameters:

* **Field Label**: Enter the field label you want to appear in the form.
* **Field Type**: Select the type of field to display in the form. Choose from:
	* **Date**
	* **Dropdown List**: Enter each dropdown options in the **Field Options**.
		* **Multiple Choice**: Select whether the user can select a single dropdown option (turned off) or multiple dropdown options (turned on)
	* **Number**
	* **Password**
	* **Text**
	* **Textarea**
* **Required Field**: Set whether the user must complete this field in order to submit the form (turned on) or if the user can submit the form without completing it (turned off).

#### Respond When

Set when to respond to the form submission. Choose from:

* **Form Is Submitted**: Respond as soon as this node receives the form submission.
* **Workflow Finishes**: Respond when the last node of this workflow finishes.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond when the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node executes.

#### Limit Wait Time

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off).

If turned on, also set:
* **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:
	* **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.
		* Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.
		* Select the limit's **Unit** of time.
	* **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.
		* **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Form Response options

* **Form Response**: Choose how and what you want the form to **Respond With** from these options:
	* **Form Submitted Text**: The form displays whatever text is entered in **Text to Show** after a user fills out the form. Use this option if you want to display a confirmation message.
	* **Redirect URL**: The form will redirect the user to the **URL to Redirect to** after they fill out the form. This must be a valid URL.
* **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'wait') ]]

## Time-based operations

For the time-based resume operations, note that:

* For wait times less than 65 seconds, the workflow doesn't offload execution data to the database. Instead, the process continues to run and the execution resumes after the specified interval passes.
* The n8n server time is always used regardless of the timezone setting. Workflow timezone settings, and any changes made to them, don't affect the Wait node interval or specified time."

# Workflow Trigger node

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered when a workflow is updated or activated.

/// warning | Deprecated
n8n has deprecated the Workflow Trigger node and moved its functionality to the [n8n Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger/).
///

/// note | Keep in mind
If you want to use the Workflow Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
///

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node parameters

The node includes a single parameter to identify the **Events** that should trigger it. Choose from these events:

- **Active Workflow Updated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.
- **Workflow Activated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.

You can select one or both of these events.

# Code node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

<!-- vale off -->
## Code doesn't return items properly
<!-- vale on -->

This error occurs when the code in your Code node doesn't return data in the expected format.

In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. Each of these objects wraps another object with the `json` key:

```javascript
[
  {
    ""json"": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]
```

To troubleshoot this error, check the following:

* Read the [data structure](/data/data-structure/) to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node.
* Understand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with [item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/).

<!-- vale off -->
## A 'json' property isn't an object
<!-- vale on -->

This error occurs when the Code node returns data where the `json` key isn't pointing to an object.

This may happen if you set `json` to a different data structure, like an array:

```javascript
[
  {
    ""json"": [
	  // Setting `json` to an array like this will produce an error
	]
  }
]
```

To resolve this, ensure that the `json` key references an object in your return data:

```javascript
[
  {
    ""json"": {
	  // Setting `json` to an object as expected
	}
  }
]
```

## Code doesn't return an object

This error may occur when your Code node doesn't return anything or if it returns an unexpected result.

To resolve this, ensure that your Code node returns the [expected data structure](/data/data-structure/):

```javascript
[
  {
    ""json"": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]
```

This error may also occur if the code you provided returns `'undefined'` instead of the expected result. In that case, ensure that the data you are referencing in your Code node exists in each execution and that it has the structure your code expects.

## 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level

This error occurs if you try to use `import` or `export` in the Code node. These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the `require` function to load modules.

To resolve this issue, try changing your `import` statements to use `require`:

```javascript
// Original code:
// import express from ""express"";
// New code:
const express = require(""express"");
```

<!-- vale off -->
## Cannot find module '&lt;module&gt;'
<!-- vale on -->

This error occurs if you try to use `require` in the Code node and n8n can't find the module.

/// warning | Only for self-hosted
n8n doesn't support importing modules in the [Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview/) version.
///

If you're [self-hosting](/hosting) n8n, follow these steps:

* Install the module into your n8n environment.
	* If you are running n8n with [npm](/hosting/installation/npm/), install the module in the same environment as n8n.
	* If you are running n8n with [Docker](/hosting/installation/docker/), you need to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/){:target=_blank .external-link} that includes your module.
* Set the `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN` and `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) to allow importing modules.

## Using global variables

Sometimes you may wish to set and retrieve simple global data related to a workflow across and within executions. For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates.

To set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the [static data](/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/) functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes.

/// info | Use Remove Duplicates when possible
If you're interested in using variables to avoid processing the same data items more than once, consider using the [Remove Duplicates node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) instead. The Remove Duplicates node can save information across executions to avoid processing the same items multiple times.

# Execute Command node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Execute Command node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

<!-- vale off -->
## Command failed: &lt;command&gt; /bin/sh: &lt;command&gt;: not found
<!-- vale on -->

This error occurs when the shell environment can't find one of the commands in the **Command** parameter.

To fix this error, review the following:

* Check that the command and its arguments don't have typos in the **Command** parameter.
* Check that the command is in the `PATH` of the user running n8n. 
* If you are running n8n with Docker, check if the command is available within the container by trying to run it manually. If your command isn't included in the container, you might have to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/){:target=_blank .external-link} that includes your command.
	* If n8n is already running:
		```sh
		# Find n8n's container ID, it will be the first column
		docker ps | grep n8n
		# Try to execute the command within the running container
		docker container exec <container_ID> <command_to_run>
		```
	* If n8n isn't running:
		```sh
		# Start up a new container that runs the command instead of n8n
		# Use the same image and tag that you use to run n8n normally
		docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n -c <command_to_run>
		```

<!-- vale off -->
## Error: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded
<!-- vale on -->

This error happens when your command returns more output than the Execute Command node is able to process at one time.

To avoid this error, reduce output your command produces. Check your command's manual page or documentation to see if there are flags to limit or filter output. If not, you may need to pipe the output to another command to remove unneeded info."

# Execute Command

The Execute Command node runs shell commands on the host machine that runs n8n.

/// note | Which shell runs the command?
This node executes the command in the default shell of the host machine. For example, `cmd` on Windows and `zsh` on macOS.

If you run n8n with Docker, your command will run in the n8n container and not the Docker host.
///

/// note | Not available on Cloud
This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.
///

## Node parameters

Configure the node using the following parameters.

### Execute Once

Choose whether you want the node to execute only once (turned on) or once for every item it receives as input (turned off).

### Command

Enter the command to execute on the host machine. Refer to sections below for examples of running [multiple commands](#run-multiple-commands) and [cURL commands](#run-curl-command).

#### Run multiple commands

Use one of two methods to run multiple commands in one Execute Command node:

* Enter each command on one line separated by `&&`. For example, you can combine the change directory (cd) command with the list (ls) command using `&&`.

    ```bash
    cd bin && ls
    ```

* Enter each command on a separate line. For example, you can write the list (ls) command on a new line after the change directory (cd) command.

    ```bash
    cd bin
    ls
    ```

#### Run cURL command

You can also use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node to make a cURL request.

If you want to run the curl command in the Execute Command node, you will have to build a Docker image based on the existing n8n image. The default n8n Docker image uses Alpine Linux. You will have to install the curl package.

1. Create a file named `Dockerfile`.
2. Add the below code snippet to the Dockerfile.

    ```shell
    FROM docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
    USER root
    RUN apk --update add curl
    USER node
    ```

3. In the same folder, execute the command below to build the Docker image.

    ```shell
    docker build -t n8n-curl
    ```

4. Replace the Docker image you used before. For example, replace `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` with `n8n-curl`.
5. Run the newly created Docker image. You'll now be able to execute ssh using the Execute Command Node.

# HTTP Request node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error displays when the node receives a 400 error indicating a bad request. This error most often occurs because:

* You're using an invalid name or value in a **Query Parameter**.
* You're passing array values in a **Query Parameter** but the array isn't formatted correctly. Try using the [**Array Format in Query Parameters**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/#array-format-in-query-parameters) option.

Review the API documentation for your service to format your query parameters.

<!-- vale off -->
## The resource you are requesting could not be found
<!-- vale on -->

This error displays when the endpoint **URL** you entered is invalid.

This may be due to a typo in the URL or a deprecated API. Refer to your service's API documentation to verify you have a valid endpoint.

## JSON parameter need to be an valid JSON

This error displays when you've passed a parameter as JSON and it's not formatted as valid JSON.

To resolve, review the JSON you've entered for these issues:

* Test your JSON in a JSON checker or syntax parser to find errors like missing quotation marks, extra or missing commas, incorrectly formatted arrays, extra or missing square brackets or curly brackets, and so on.
* If you've used an **Expression** in the node, be sure you've wrapped the entire JSON in double curly brackets, for example:
    ```
    {{
        {
        ""myjson"":
        {
            ""name1"": ""value1"",
            ""name2"": ""value2"",
            ""array1"":
                [""value1"",""value2""]
        }
        }
    }}
    ```

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials

This error displays when the node receives a 403 error indicating authentication failed.

To resolve, review the selected credentials and make sure you can authenticate with them. You may need to:

* Update permissions or scopes so that your API key or account can perform the operation you've selected.
* Format your generic credential in a different way.
* Generate a new API key or token with the appropriate permissions or scopes.

## 429 - The service is receiving too many requests from you

This error displays when the node receives a [429 error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429){:target=_blank .external-link} from the service that you're calling. This often means that you have hit the rate limits of that service. You can find out more on the [Handling API rate limits](/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/) page.

To resolve the error, you can use one of the built-in options of the HTTP request node:

### Batching

Use this option to send requests in batches and introduce a delay between them.

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option > Batching**.
1. Set **Items per Batch** to the number of input items to include in each request.
1. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests in milliseconds. For example, to send one request to an API per second, set **Batch Interval (ms)** to `1000`.

### Retry on Fail

Use this option to retry the node after a failed attempt.

1. In the HTTP Request node, go to **Settings** and enable **Retry on Fail**.
1. Set **Max Tries** to the maximum number of times n8n should retry the node.
1. Set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to the desired delay in milliseconds between retries. For example, to wait one second before retrying the request again, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000`."

# HTTP Request node

The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes in n8n. It allows you to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or service with a REST API.

When using this node, you're creating a REST API call. You need some understanding of basic API terminology and concepts.

There are two ways to create an HTTP request: configure the [node parameters](#node-parameters) or [import a curl command](#import-curl-command).

/// note | Credentials
Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 
///

## Node parameters

### Method

Select the method to use for the request:

- DELETE
- GET
- HEAD
- OPTIONS
- PATCH
- POST
- PUT

### URL

Enter the endpoint you want to use.

### Authentication

n8n recommends using the **Predefined Credential Type** option when it's available. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

#### Predefined credentials

Credentials for integrations supported by n8n, including both built-in and community nodes. Use **Predefined Credential Type** for custom operations without extra setup. Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.

#### Generic credentials

Credentials for integrations not supported by n8n. You'll need to manually configure the authentication process, including specifying the required API endpoints, necessary parameters, and the authentication method. 

You can select one of the following methods:

* Basic auth
* Custom auth
* Digest auth
* Header auth
* OAuth1 API
* OAuth2 API
* Query auth

Refer to [HTTP request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Send Query Parameters

Query parameters act as filters on HTTP requests. If the API you're interacting with supports them and the request you're making needs a filter, turn this option on.

**Specify your query parameters** using one of the available options:

* **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Query Parameters**. To enter more query parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the name of the field you're filtering on, and the value is the filter value.
* **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your query parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

### Send Headers

Use this parameter to send headers with your request. Headers contain metadata or context about your request.

**Specify Headers** using one of the available options:

* **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Header Parameters**. To enter more header parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the header you wish to set, and the value is the value you want to pass for that header.
* **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your header parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

### Send Body

If you need to send a body with your API request, turn this option on.

Then select the **Body Content Type** that best matches the format for the body content you wish to send.

#### Form URLencoded

Use this option to send your body as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

**Specify Body** using one of the available options:

* **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Body Parameters**. To enter more body parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name should be the form field name, and the value is what you wish to set that field to.
* **Using Single Field**: Enter your name/value pairs in a single **Body** parameter with format `fieldname1=value1&fieldname2=value2`.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

#### Form-Data

Use this option to send your body as `multipart/form-data`.

Configure your **Body Parameters** by selecting the **Parameter Type**:

* Choose **Form Data** to enter **Name**/**Value** pairs.
* Choose **n8n Binary File** to pull the body from a file the node has access to.
    * **Name**: Enter the ID of the field to set.
    * **Input Data Field Name**: Enter the name of the incoming field containing the binary file data you want to process.

Select **Add Parameter** to enter more parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

#### JSON

Use this option to send your body as JSON.

**Specify Body** using one of the available options:

* **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Body Parameters**. To enter more body parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**.
* **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your body.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

#### n8n Binary File

Use this option to send the contents of a file stored in n8n as the body.

Enter the name of the incoming field that contains the file as the **Input Data Field Name**.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance on how to format the file.

#### Raw

Use this option to send raw data in the body.

* **Content Type**: Enter the `Content-Type` header to use for the raw body content. Refer to the IANA [Media types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for a full list of MIME content types.
* **Body**: Enter the raw body content to send.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view and select these options. Options are available to all parameters unless otherwise noted.

### Array Format in Query Parameters

/// note | Option availability
This option is only available when you turn on **Send Query Parameters**.
///

Use this option to control the format for arrays included in query parameters. Choose from these options:

* **No Brackets**: Arrays will format as the name=value for each item in the array, for example: `foo=bar&foo=qux`.
* **Brackets Only**: The node adds square brackets after each array name, for example: `foo[]=bar&foo[]=qux`.
* **Brackets with Indices**: The node adds square brackets with an index value after each array name, for example: `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=qux`.

Refer to your service's API documentation for guidance on which option to use.

### Batching

Control how to batch large numbers of input items:

* **Items per Batch**: Enter the number of input items to include in each batch.
* **Batch Interval**: Enter the time to wait between each batch of requests in milliseconds. Enter 0 for no batch interval.

### Ignore SSL Issues

By default, n8n only downloads the response if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to download the response even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn this option on.

### Lowercase Headers

Choose whether to lowercase header names (turned on, default) or not (turned off).

### Redirects

Choose whether to follow redirects (turned on by default) or not (turned off). If turned on, enter the maximum number of redirects the request should follow in **Max Redirects**.

### Response

Use this option to set some details about the expected API response, including:

* **Include Response Headers and Status**: By default, the node returns only the body. Turn this option on to return the full response (headers and response status code) as well as the body.
* **Never Error**: By default, the node returns success only when the response returns with a 2xx code. Turn this option on to return success regardless of the code returned.
* **Response Format**: Select the format in which the data gets returned. Choose from:
    * **Autodetect** (default): The node detects and formats the response based on the data returned.
    * **File**: Select this option to put the response into a file. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.
    * **JSON**: Select this option to format the response as JSON.
    * **Text**: Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.

### Pagination

Use this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.

/// note | Inspect the API data first
Some options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.
///
??? Details ""Understand pagination""
    Pagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.
  
    For example, you make an API call to an endpoint called `/users`. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response. 
  
    If the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call `/users` with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.

Configure the pagination settings:

* **Pagination Mode**:
    * **Off**: Turn off pagination.
    * **Update a Parameter in Each Request**: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.
    * **Response Contains Next URL**: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set **Next URL**.

For example setups, refer to [HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination](/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination/).

n8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/http/pagination-variables.md""

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/http/pagination-api-differences.md""

### Proxy

Use this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.

Enter the **Proxy** the request should use.

### Timeout

Use this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.

Enter the **Timeout** time to wait in milliseconds.

## Import curl command

[curl](https://curl.se/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.

You can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.

Import a curl command:

1. From the HTTP Request node's **Parameters** tab, select **Import cURL**. The **Import cURL command** modal opens.
2. Paste your curl command into the text box.
3. Select **Import**. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.

# Remove Duplicates node

Use the Remove Duplicates node to identify and delete items that are:

* identical across all fields or a subset of fields in a single execution
* identical to or surpassed by items seen in previous executions

This is helpful in situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.

By comparing against data from previous executions, the Remove Duplicates node can  delete items seen in earlier executions. It can also ensure that new items have a later date or a higher value than previous values.

/// note | Major changes in 1.64.0
The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 1.64.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/7a66308290e6e5b104fcb82a3beafa0d6987df36/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates.md){:target=_blank .external-link}.
///

## Operation modes

The remove duplication node works differently depending on the value of the **operation** parameter:

* **[Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input)**: Identify and remove duplicate items in the current input across all fields or a subset of fields.
* **[Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions)**: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates.
* **[Clear Deduplication History](#clear-deduplication-history)**: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input

When you set the ""Operations"" field to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**, the Remove Duplicate node identifies and removes duplicate items in the current input. It can do this across all fields, or within a subset of fields.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input parameters

When using the **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input** operation, the following parameter is available:

* **Compare**: Select which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:
	* **All Fields**: Compares all fields of the input data.
	* **All Fields Except**: Enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.
	* **Selected Fields**: Enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input options

If you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields** as your compare type, you can add these options:

* **Disable Dot Notation**: Set whether to use dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child` (turned off) or not (turn on).
* **Remove Other Fields**: Set whether to remove any fields that aren't used in the comparison (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions

When you set the ""Operation"" field to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**, the Remove Duplicate node compares items in the current input to items from previous executions.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions parameters

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following parameters are available:

* **Keep Items Where**: Select how n8n decides which items to keep. The following options are available:
	* **Value Is New**: n8n removes items if their value matches items from earlier executions.
	* **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**: n8n removes items if the current value isn't higher than previous values.
	* **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**: n8n removes date items if the current date isn't later than previous dates.

* **Value to Dedupe On**: The input field or fields to compare. The option you select for the **Keep Items Where** parameter determines the exact format you need:
	* When using **Value Is New**, this must be an input field or combination of fields with a unique ID.
	* When using **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**, this must be an input field or combination of fields that has an incremental value.
	* When using **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**, this must be an input field that has a date value in ISO format.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions options

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following option is available:

* **Scope**: Sets how n8n stores and uses the deduplication data for comparisons. The following options are available:
	* **Node**: (default) Stores the data for this node independently from other Remove Duplicates instances in the workflow. When you use this scope, you can [clear the duplication history](#clear-deduplication-history) for this node instance without affecting other nodes.
	* **Workflow**: Stores the duplication data at the workflow level. This shares duplication data with any other Remove Duplicate nodes set to use ""workflow"" scope.  n8n will still manage the duplication data for other Remove Duplicate nodes set to ""node"" scope independently.

When you select **Value Is New** as your **Keep Items Where** choice, this option is also available:

* **History Size**: The number of items for n8n to store to track duplicates across executions. The value of the **Scope** option determines whether this history size is specific to this individual Remove Duplicate node instance or shared with other instances in the workflow. By default, n8n stores 10,000 items.

### Clear Deduplication History

When you set the ""Operation"" field to **Clear Deduplication History**, the Remove Duplicates node manages and clears the stored items from previous executions. This operation doesn't affect any items in the current input. Instead, it manages the database of items that the ""Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions"" operation uses.

#### Clear Deduplication History parameters

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following parameter is available:

* **Mode**: How you want to manage the key / value items stored in the database. The following option is available:
	* **Clean Database**: Deletes all duplication data stored in the database. This resets the duplication database to its original state.

#### Clear Deduplication History options

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following option is available:

* **Scope**: Sets the scope n8n uses when managing the duplication database.
	* **Node**: (default) Manages the duplication database specific to this Remove Duplicates node instance.
	* **Workflow**: Manages the duplication database shared by all Remove Duplicate node instances that use workflow scope.

## Set up sample data using the Code node

Create a workflow with some example input data to try out the Remove Duplicates node.

1. Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Manual Trigger node.
2. In the Code node, set **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item** and **Language** to **JavaScript**.
3. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript** field:
```js
let data =[];

return {
  data: [
    { id: 1, name: 'Taylor Swift', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Ed Sheeran', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Adele', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z' },
    { id: 4, name: 'Bruno Mars', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z' },
    { id: 1, name: 'Taylor Swift', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z' },  // duplicate
    { id: 5, name: 'Billie Eilish', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z' },
    { id: 6, name: 'Katy Perry', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Ed Sheeran', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z' },  // duplicate

    //{ id: 10, name: 'Harry Nilsson', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2020-10-17T17:11:38.493Z' },
    //{ id: 11, name: 'Kylie Minogue', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-10-24T08:03:16.493Z'},
  ]
}
```
4. Add a Split Out node to the canvas and connect it to the Code node.
5. In the Split Out node, enter `data` in the **Fields To Split Out** field.

## Removing duplicates from the current input

1. Add a Remove Duplicates node to the canvas and connect it to the Split Out node. Choose **Remove items repeated within current input** as the **Action** to start.
2. Open the Remove Duplicates node and ensure that the **Operation** is set to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**.
3. Choose **All fields** in the **Compare** field.
4. Select **Test step** to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.

n8n removes the items that have the same data across all fields. Your output in table view should look like this:

<!-- vale off -->
| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |
| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |
| 4      | Bruno Mars    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z |
| 5      | Billie Eilish | Singer-songwriter | 2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z |
| 6      | Katy Perry    | Pop star          | 2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z |
| 7      | Lady Gaga     | Pop star          | 2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z |
| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |
<!-- vale on -->

5. Open the Remove Duplicates node again and change the **Compare** parameter to **Selected Fields**.
6. In the **Fields To Compare** field, enter `job`.
7. Select **Test step** to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.

n8n removes the items in the current input that have the same `job` data. Your output in table view should look like this:

<!-- vale off -->
| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |
<!-- vale on -->

## Keep items where the value is new

1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
2. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is New**.
3. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.name }}`.
4. On the canvas, select **Test workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node with this operation, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

<!-- vale off -->
| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |

/// note | Items are only compared against previous executions
The current input items are only compared against the stored items from previous executions. This means that items repeated within the current input aren't removed in this mode of operation. If you need to remove duplicate items within the current input *and* across executions, connect two Remove Duplicate nodes together sequentially. Set the first to use the **Remove Items Repated Within Current Input** operation and the second to use the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation.

# Schedule Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Schedule Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Invalid cron expression

This error occurs when you set **Trigger Interval** to **Custom (Cron)** and n8n doesn't understand your cron expression. This may mean that there is a mistake in your cron expression or that you're using an incompatible syntax.

To debug, check that the following:

* That your cron expression follows the syntax used in the [cron examples](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/#custom-cron-interval)
* That your cron expression (after removing the [seconds column](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/#why-there-are-six-asterisks-in-the-cron-expression)) validates on [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/)

## Scheduled workflows run at the wrong time

If the Schedule Trigger node runs at the wrong time, it may mean that you need to adjust the time zone n8n uses.

### Adjust the timezone globally

If you're using [n8n Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview/), follow the instructions on the [set the Cloud instance timezone](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) page to ensure that n8n executes in sync with your local time.

If you're [self hosting](/hosting/), set your global timezone using the [`GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/).

### Adjust the timezone for an individual workflow

To set the timezone for an individual workflow:

1. Open the workflow on the canvas.
1. Select the <span class=""inline-image"">![three dots menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png)</span> **Three dots icon** in the upper-right corner.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Change the **Timezone** setting.
1. Select **Save**."

# Schedule Trigger node

Use the Schedule Trigger node to run workflows at fixed intervals and times. This works in a similar way to the Cron software utility in Unix-like systems.

/// note | You must activate the workflow
If a workflow uses the Schedule node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow. 
///

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/schedule/timezone-settings.md""

## Node parameters

Add **Trigger Rules** to determine when the trigger should run.

Use the **Trigger Interval** to select the time interval unit of measure to schedule the trigger for. All other parameters depend on the interval you select. Choose from:

- [Seconds trigger interval](#seconds-trigger-interval)
- [Minutes trigger interval](#minutes-trigger-interval)
- [Hours trigger interval](#hours-trigger-interval)
- [Days trigger interval](#days-trigger-interval)
- [Weeks trigger interval](#weeks-trigger-interval)
- [Months trigger interval](#months-trigger-interval)
- [Custom (Cron) interval](#custom-cron-interval)

You can add multiple **Trigger Rules** to run the node on different schedules.

Refer to the sections below for more detail on configuring each **Trigger Interval**. Refer to [Templates and examples](#templates-and-examples) for further examples.

### Seconds trigger interval

* **Seconds Between Triggers**: Enter the number of seconds between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the trigger will run every 30 seconds.

### Minutes trigger interval

* **Minutes Between Triggers**: Enter the number of minutes between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `5` here, the trigger will run every 5 minutes.

### Hours trigger interval

* **Hours Between Triggers**: Enter the number of hours between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `6` **Hours Between Triggers** and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every six hours at 30 minutes past the hour.

### Days trigger interval

* **Days Between Triggers**: Enter the number of days between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

<!-- vale from-microsoft.AMPM = NO -->
For example, if you enter `2` **Days Between Triggers**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `15` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two days at 9:15am.
<!-- vale from-microsoft.AMPM = YES -->

### Weeks trigger interval

* **Weeks Between Triggers**: Enter the number of weeks between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger on Weekdays**: Select the day(s) of the week you want to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `2` **Weeks Between Triggers**, **Monday** for **Trigger on Weekdays**, **3pm** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two weeks on Monday at 3:30 PM.

### Months trigger interval

* **Months Between Triggers**: Enter the number of months between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger at Day of Month**: Enter the day of the month the day should trigger at, from `1` to `31`. If a month doesn't have this day, the node won't trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the node won't trigger in February.
* **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `3` **Months Between Triggers**, `28` **Trigger at Day of Month**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `0` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run each quarter on the 28th day of the month at 9:00 AM.

### Custom (Cron) interval

Enter a custom cron **Expression** to set the schedule for the trigger.

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru){:target=_blank .external-link}. Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Expression** field in n8n.

#### Examples

<!-- vale from-write-good.Weasel = NO -->
|Type|Cron Expression|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Every X Seconds|`*/10 * * * * *`|Every 10 seconds.|
|Every X Minutes|`*/5 * * * *`|Every 5 minutes.|
|Hourly|`0 * * * *`|Every hour on the hour.|
|Daily|`0 6 * * *`|At 6:00 AM every day.|
|Weekly|`0 12 * * 1`|At noon every Monday.|
|Monthly|`0 0 1 * *`|At midnight on the 1st of every month.|
|Every X Days|`0 0 */3 * *`|At midnight every 3rd day.|
|Only Weekdays|`0 9 * * 1-5`|At 9:00 AM Monday through Friday.|
|Custom Hourly Range|`0 9-17 * * *`|Every hour from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day.|
|Quarterly|`0 0 1 1,4,7,10 *`|At midnight on the 1st of January, April, July, and October.|
<!-- vale from-write-good.Weasel = YES -->

#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression

The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

|  (*)  |  *  |  *  |  *  |  *  |  *  |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|(second)|minute|hour|day of month|month|day of week(Sun-Sat)|

# Common issues and questions

Here are some common issues and questions for the [Webhook node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) and suggested solutions.

## Listen for multiple HTTP methods

By default, the Webhook node accepts calls that use a single method. For example, it can accept GET or POST requests, but not both. If you want to accept calls using multiple methods:

1. Open the node **Settings**.
1. Turn on **Allow Multiple HTTP Methods**.
1. Return to **Parameters**. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the **HTTP Methods** field.

The Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method.

## Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node

The [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify.

1. Create a new workflow.
2. Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow.
3. Select a method from the **Request Method** dropdown list. For example, if you select GET as the **HTTP method** in your Webhook node, select GET as the request method in the HTTP Request node.
4. Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the **URL** field in the HTTP Request node.
5. If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node.
6. Execute the HTTP Request node.

## Use curl to trigger the Webhook node

You can use [curl](https://curl.se/){:target=_blank .external-link} to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node. 

/// note
In the examples, replace `<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>` with your webhook URL.  
The examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in **HTTP Method**.
///

Make an HTTP request without any parameters:

```sh
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>
```

Make an HTTP request with a body parameter:

```sh
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --data 'key=value'
```

Make an HTTP request with header parameter:

```sh
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --header 'key=value'
```

Make an HTTP request to send a file:

```sh
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --from 'key=@/path/to/file'
```
Replace `/path/to/file` with the path of the file you want to send.

## Send a response of type string

By default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string:

1. Select **Response Mode** > **When Last Node Finishes**.
2. Select **Response Data** > **First Entry JSON**.
3. Select **Add Option** > **Property Name**.
4. Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to `data`.
5. Connect an [Edit Fields node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) to the Webhook node.
6. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add Value** > **String**.
7. Enter the name of the property in the **Name** field. The name should match the property name from step 4.
8. Enter the string value in the **Value** field.
9. Toggle **Keep Only Set** to on (green).

When you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node.

## Test URL versus Production URL

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Once you're ready to use your Webhook URL in production, use the **Production URL**.

| **URL type** | **How to trigger** | **Listening duration** | **Data shown in editor UI?** | 
| :--- | --- | --- | :---: |
| Test URL | Select **Listen for test event** and trigger a test event from the source. | 120 seconds | :white_check_mark: |
| Production URL | Activate the workflow | Until workflow deactivated | :x: |

Refer to [Workflow development](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/workflow-development/) for more information.

## IPs in Whitelist are failing to connect

If you're unable to connect from IPs in your IP Whitelist, check if you are running n8n behind a reverse proxy.

If so, set the `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) to the number of reverse-proxies n8n is running behind."

# Webhook node

Use the Webhook node to create [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook){:target=_blank .external-link}, which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.

You can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for build a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.

The webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node.

## Workflow development process

n8n provides different **Webhook URL**s for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to **Listen for test event**. Refer to [Workflow development](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/workflow-development/) for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production.

## Node parameters

Use these parameters to configure your node.

### Webhook URLs

The Webhook node has two **Webhook URLs**: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.

Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

<figure markdown=""span"">
![Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab display a Test URL and Production URL](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-urls.png)
<figcaption>Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab</figcaption>
</figure>

* **Test**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Test workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
* **Production**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### HTTP Method

The Webhook node supports standard [HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods){:target=_blank .external-link}:

* DELETE
* GET
* HEAD
* PATCH
* POST
* PUT

    /// note | Webhook max payload
	The webhook maximum payload size is 16MB.
  If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the [endpoint environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/) `N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX`.
	///	

### Path

By default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes. 

You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.

The **Path** field can take the following formats:

- `/:variable`
- `/path/:variable`
- `/:variable/path`
- `/:variable1/path/:variable2`
- `/:variable1/:variable2`

### Supported authentication methods

You can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL. Choose from these authentication methods:

- Basic auth
- Header auth
- JWT auth
- None

Refer to [Webhook credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/webhook/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Respond

* **Immediately**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the message **Workflow got started**.
* **When Last Node Finishes**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: The Webhook node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

### Response Code

Customize the [HTTP response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status){:target=_blank .external-link} that the Webhook node returns upon successful execution. Select from common response codes or create a custom code.

### Response Data

Choose what data to include in the response body:

* **All Entries**: The Webhook returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
* **First Entry JSON**: The Webhook returns the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
* **First Entry Binary**: The Webhook returns the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
* **No Response Body**: The Webhook returns without a body.

Applies only to **Respond > When Last Node Finishes**.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options. The available options depend on your node parameters. Refer to the table for option availability.

* **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: Set the permitted cross-origin domains. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests. Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.
* **Binary Property**: Enabling this setting allows the Webhook node to receive binary data, such as an image or audio file. Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to.
* **Ignore Bots**: Ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
* **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enable this to limit who (or what) can invoke a Webhook trigger URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook trigger URL.
* **No Response Body**: Enable this to prevent n8n sending a body with the response.
* **Raw Body**: Specify that the Webhook node will receive data in a raw format, such as JSON or XML.
* **Response Content-Type**: Choose the format for the webhook body.
* **Response Data**: Send custom data with the response.
* **Response Headers**: Send extra headers in the Webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header){:target=_blank .external-link} to learn more about response headers.
* **Property Name**: by default, n8n returns all available data. You can choose to return a specific JSON key, so that n8n returns the value.

| Option | Required node configuration |
| ------ | --------------------------- | 
| Allowed Origins (CORS) | Any |
| Binary Property | Either: <br />HTTP Method > POST <br /> HTTP Method > PATCH <br /> HTTP Method > PUT |
| Ignore Bots | Any |

# Workflow development

The [Webhook node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) works a bit differently from other core nodes. n8n recommends following these processes for building, testing, and using your Webhook node in production.

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

## Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test** webhook URL.

Using a test webhook ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. Select **Listen for test event** to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.

When using the Webhook node on localhost on a [self-hosted](/hosting/) n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:

* [npm with tunnel](/hosting/installation/npm/#n8n-with-tunnel)
* [Docker with tunnel](/hosting/installation/docker/#n8n-with-tunnel)

<video src=""/_video/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-node-intro.mp4"" controls width=""100%""></video>

## Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production** webhook URL. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.

When working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.

Refer to [Create a workflow](/workflows/create/) for more information on activating workflows."

# Chat Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Chat Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Pass data from a website to an embedded Chat Trigger node

When [embedding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) the Chat Trigger node in a website, you might want to pass extra information to the Chat Trigger. For example, passing a user ID stored in a site cookie.

To do this, use the `metadata` field in the JSON object you pass to the `createChat` function in your embedded chat window:

```javascript
createChat({
	webhookUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL',
	metadata: {
		'YOUR_KEY': 'YOUR_DATA'
	};
});
```

The `metadata` field can contain arbitrary data that will appear in the Chat Trigger output alongside other output data. From there, you can query and process the data from downstream nodes as usual using	n8n's [data processing features](/data/).

## Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages

When you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a `workflow could not be started!` error.

In Chat Triggers, the **Load Previous Session** option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the `sessionID`. When you set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From memory**, it's almost always best to [connect the same memory node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/#load-previous-session) to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow:

1. In your **Chat Trigger** node, set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From Memory**. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available.
2. Attach a **Window Buffer Memory** node to the **Memory** connector.
3. Attach the same **Window Buffer Memory** node to **Memory** connector of your **Agent**.
4. In the **Window Buffer Memory** node, set **Session ID** to **Take from previous node automatically**.

One instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the **Session ID** in your memory node to **Define below**.

If you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis."

# Chat Trigger node

Use the Chat Trigger node when building AI workflows for chatbots and other chat interfaces. You can configure how users access the chat, using one of n8n's provided interfaces, or your own. You can add authentication.

You must connect either an agent or chain [root node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/).

/// warning | Workflow execution usage
Every message to the Chat Trigger executes your workflow. This means that one conversation where a user sends 10 messages uses 10 executions from your execution allowance. Check your payment plan for details of your allowance.
///

/// note | Manual Chat trigger
This node replaces the Manual Chat Trigger node from version 1.24.0.
///

## Node parameters

### Make Chat Publicly Available

Set whether the chat should be publicly available (turned on) or only available through the manual chat interface (turned off).

Leave this turned off while you're building the workflow. Turn it on when you're ready to activate the workflow and allow users to access the chat.

### Mode

Choose how users access the chat. Select from:

* **Hosted Chat**: Use n8n's hosted chat interface. Recommended for most users because you can configure the interface using the [node options](#node-options) and don't have to do any other setup.
* **Embedded Chat**: This option requires you to create your own chat interface. You can use n8n's [chat widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat){:target=_blank .external-link} or build your own. Your chat interface must call the webhook URL shown in **Chat URL** in the node.

### Authentication

Choose whether and how to restrict access to the chat. Select from:

* **None**: The chat doesn't use authentication. Anyone can use the chat.
* **Basic Auth**: The chat uses basic authentication.
	* Select or create a **Credential for Basic Auth** with a username and password. All users must use the same username and password.
* **n8n User Auth**: Only users logged in to an n8n account can use the chat.

### Initial Message(s)

This parameter's only available if you're using **Hosted Chat**. Use it to configure the message the n8n chat interface displays when the user arrives on the page.

## Node options

Available options depend on the chat mode.

### Hosted chat options

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Input Placeholder, Title, and Subtitle

Enter the text for these elements in the chat interface.

??? Details ""View screenshot""
	![Customizable text elements](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/hosted-text-elements.png)

#### Load Previous Session

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off**, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

??? Details ""View screenshot""
	![Connect nodes to memory](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/connect-memory.png)

#### Response Mode

Use this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:

* **When Last Node Finishes**: The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

#### Require Button Click to Start Chat

Set whether to display a **New Conversation** button on the chat interface (turned on) or not (turned off).

??? Details ""View screenshot""
	![New Conversation button](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/new-conversation-button.png)


### Embedded chat options

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Load Previous Session

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off**, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

## Set the chat response manually

You need to manually set the chat response when you don't want to directly send the output of an Agent or Chain node to the user. Instead, you want to take the output of an Agent or Chain node and modify it or do something else with it before sending it back to the user.

In a basic workflow, the Agent and Chain nodes output a parameter named either `output` or `text`, and the Chat trigger sends the value of this parameter to the user as the chat response. 

If you need to manually create the response sent to the user, you must create a parameter named either `text` or `output`. If you use a different parameter name, the Chat trigger sends the entire object as its response, not just the value.

To get these, create an Adalo app:

1. From the app dropdown in the top navigation, select **CREATE NEW APP**.
1. Select the App Layout type that makes sense for you and select **Next**.
    - If you're new to using the product, Adalo recommend using **Mobile Only**.
1. Select a template to get started with or select **Blank**, then select **Next**.
1. Enter an **App Name**, like `n8n integration`.
1. If applicable, select the **Team** for the app.
1. Select branding colors.
1. Select **Create**. The app editor opens.
1. In the left menu, select **Settings** (the gear cog icon).
1. Select **App Access**.
1. In the **API Key** section, select **Generate Key**.
    - If you don't have the correct plan level, you'll see a prompt to upgrade instead.
1. Copy the key and enter it as the **API Key** in your n8n credential.
1. The URL includes the **App ID** after `https://app.adalo.com/apps/`. For example, if the URL for your app is `https://app.adalo.com/apps/b78bdfcf-48dc-4550-a474-dd52c19fc371/app-settings`, `b78bdfcf-48dc-4550-a474-dd52c19fc371` is the App ID. Copy this value and enter it in your n8n credential.

## Prerequisites

Create a [Customer.io](https://customer.io/) account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API Key

## Related resources

Refer to [Customer.io's summary API documentation](https://customer.io/docs/api/?api=journeys){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

For detailed API reference documentation for each API, refer to the [Track API documentation](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/){:target=_blank .external-link} and the [App API documentation](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Tracking API Key**: For use with the [Track API](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/){:target=_blank .external-link} at `https://track.customer.io/api/v1/`. See the FAQs below for more details.
- Your **Region**: Customer.io uses different API subdomains depending on the region you select. Options include:
    - **Global region**: Keeps the default URLs for both APIs; for use in all non-EU countries/regions.
    - **EU region**: Adjusts the Track API subdomain to `track-eu` and the App API subdomain to `api-eu`; only use this if you are in the EU.
- A **Tracking Site ID**: Required with your **Tracking API Key**
- An **App API Key**: For use with the [App API](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/){:target=_blank .external-link} at `https://api.customer.io/v1/api/`. See the FAQs below for more details.

Refer to the [Customer.io Finding and managing your API credentials documentation](https://customer.io/docs/accounts-and-workspaces/managing-credentials/){:target=_blank .external-link} for instructions on creating both Tracking API and App API keys.

## Why you need a Tracking API Key and an App API Key

Customer.io has two different API endpoints and generates and stores the keys for each slightly differently:

- The [Track API](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/){:target=_blank .external-link} at `https://track.customer.io/api/v1/`
- The [App API](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/){:target=_blank .external-link} at `https://api.customer.io/v1/api/`

The Track API requires a Tracking Site ID; the App API doesn't.

Based on the operation you want to perform, n8n uses the correct API key and its corresponding endpoint."

## Prerequisites

- Create a [Discord](https://www.discord.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.
- For Bot and OAuth2 credentials:
    - [Set up your local developer environment](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-0-project-setup){:target=_blank .external-link}.
    - [Create an application and a bot user](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app){:target=_blank .external-link}.
- For webhook credentials, [create a webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Supported authentication methods

- Bot
- OAuth2
- Webhook

Not sure which method to use? Refer to [Choose an authentication method](#choose-an-authentication-method) for more guidance.

## Related resources

Refer to [Discord's Developer documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using bot

Use this method if you want to add the bot to your Discord server using a bot token rather than OAuth2.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Bot Token**: Generated once you create an application with a bot.

To create an application with a bot and generate the **Bot Token**:

1. If you don't have one already, create an app in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Enter a **Name** for your app.
3. Select **Create**.
4. Select **Bot** from the left menu.
5. Under **Token**, select **Reset Token** to generate a new bot token. 
6. Copy the token and add it to your n8n credential.
7. In **Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents**, add any privileged intents you want your bot to have. Refer to [Configuring your bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#configuring-your-bot){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on privileged intents.
    - n8n recommends activating **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT: Required for your bot to receive events listed under GUILD_MEMBERS**. 
8. In **Installation > Installation Contexts**, select the installation contexts you want your bot to use:
    - Select **Guild Install** for server-installed apps. (Most common for n8n users.)
    - Select **User Install** for user-installed apps. (Less common for n8n users, but may be useful for testing.)
    - Refer to Discord's [Choosing installation contexts](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#choosing-installation-contexts){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information about these installation contexts.
9. In **Installation > Install Link**, select **Discord Provided Link** if it's not already selected.
10. Still on the **Installation** page, in the **Default Install Settings** section, select `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes. Refer to Discord's [Scopes](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information about these and other scopes.
11. Add permissions on the **Bot > Bot Permissions** page. Refer to Discord's [Permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information. n8n recommends selecting these permissions for the [Discord](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) node:
    - Manage Roles
    - Manage Channels
    - Read Messages/View Channels
    - Send Messages
    - Create Public Threads
    - Create Private Threads
    - Send Messages in Threads
    - Send TTS Messages
    - Manage Messages
    - Manage Threads
    - Embed Links
    - Attach Files
    - Read Message History
    - Add Reactions
12. Add the app to your server or test server:
    1. Go to **Installation > Install Link** and copy the link listed there.
    2. Paste the link in your browser and hit Enter.
    1. Select **Add to server** in the installation prompt.
    1. Once your app's added to your server, you'll see it in the member list.

These steps outline the basic functionality needed to set up your n8n credential. Refer to the [Discord Creating an App](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app){:target=_blank .external-link} guide for more information on creating an app, especially:

- [Fetching your credentials](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#fetching-your-credentials){:target=_blank .external-link} for getting your app's credentials into your local developer environment.
- [Handling interactivity](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-3-handling-interactivity){:target=_blank .external-link} for information on setting up public endpoints for interactive `/slash` commands.

## Using OAuth2

Use this method if you want to add the bot to Discord servers using the OAuth2 flow, which simplifies the process for those installing your app.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**
- Choose whether to send **Authentication** in the **Header** or **Body**
- A **Bot Token**

For details on creating an application with a bot and generating the token, follow the same steps as in [Using bot](#using-bot) above.

Then:

1. Copy the **Bot Token** you generate and add it into the n8n credential.
2. Open the **OAuth2** page in your Discord application to access your **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**. Add these to your n8n credential.
3. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it into the Discord application in **OAuth2 > Redirects**. Be sure you save these changes.

## Using webhook

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Webhook URL**: Generated once you create a webhook.

To get a Webhook URL, you create a webhook and copy the URL that gets generated:

1. Open your Discord **Server Settings** and open the **Integrations** tab.
2. Select **Create Webhook** to create a new webhook.
3. Give your webhook a **Name** that makes sense.
3. Select the **avatar** next to the **Name** to edit or upload a new avatar.
4. In the **CHANNEL** dropdown, select the channel the webhook should post to.
5. Select **Copy Webhook URL** to copy the Webhook URL. Enter this URL in your n8n credential.

Refer to the [Discord Making a Webhook documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Choose an authentication method

The simplest installation is a **webhook**. You create and add webhooks to a single channel on a Discord server. Webhooks can post messages to a channel. They don't require a bot user or authentication. But they can't listen or respond to user requests or commands. If you need a straightforward way to send messages to a channel without the need for interaction or feedback, use a webhook.

A **bot** is an interactive step up from a webhook. You add bots to the Discord server (referred to as a `guild` in the Discord API documentation) or to user accounts. Bots added to the server can interact with users on all the server's channels. They can manage channels, send and retrieve messages, retrieve the list of all users, and change their roles. If you need to build an interactive, complex, or multi-step workflow, use a bot.

**OAuth2** is basically a **bot** that uses an OAuth2 flow rather than just the bot token. As with bots, you add these to the Discord server or to user accounts. These credentials offer the same functionalities as bots, but they can simplify the installation of the bot on your server."

///

## Supported authentication methods

- App access token

## Related resources

Refer to [Meta's Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using app access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- An app **Access Token**
- An optional **App Secret**: Used to verify the integrity and origin of the payload.

There are five steps in setting up your credential:

1. [Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the Webhooks product.
2. [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.
3. [Configure the Facebook trigger](#configure-the-facebook-trigger).
4. Optional: [Add an app secret](#optional-add-an-app-secret).
5. [App Review](#app-review): Only required if your app's users don't have roles on the app itself. If you're creating the app for your own internal purposes, this isn't necessary.

Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step.

### Create a Meta app

To create a Meta app:

1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps){:target=_blank .external-link} and select **Create App**.
2. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
3. Select **Other**, then select **Next**.
4. Select **Business** and **Next**.
5. Complete the essential information:
    * Add an **App name**.
    * Add an **App contact email**.
    * Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app ""Live."")
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
1. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.
6. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select **Webhooks**.
7. The **Webhooks** product opens.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types){:target=_blank .external-link}.

### Generate an App Access Token

Next, create an app access token to be used by your n8n credential and the Webhooks product:

1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.
3. In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.
4. Select **Generate Access Token**.
5. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.

    /// warning | App unavailable
    You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.
    ///

5. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**. Save this token somewhere else, too, since you'll need it for the Webhooks configuration.
6. Save your n8n credential.

Refer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on generating the token.

### Configure the Facebook Trigger

Now that you have a token, you can configure the Facebook Trigger node:

1. In your Meta app, copy the **App ID** from the top navigation bar.
1. In n8n, open your Facebook Trigger node.
2. Paste the **App ID** into the **APP ID** field.
3. Select **Test step** to shift the trigger into listening mode.
6. Return to the tab or window where your Meta app's **Webhooks** product configuration is open.
7. **Subscribe** to the objects you want to receive Facebook Trigger notifications about. For each subscription:
    1. Copy the **Webhook URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Callback URL** in your Meta App.
    1. Enter the **Access Token** you copied above as the **Verify token**.
    1. Select **Verify and save**. (This step fails if you don't have your n8n trigger listening.)
    1. Some webhook subscriptions, like **User**, prompt you to subscribe to individual events. Subscribe to the events you're interested in.
    1. You can send some **Test** events from Meta to confirm things are working. If you send a test event, verify its receipt in n8n.

Refer to the [Facebook Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/) documentation for more information.

### Optional: Add an App Secret

For added security, Meta recommends adding an **App Secret**. This signs all API calls with the `appsecret_proof` parameter. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key.

To generate an App Secret:

1. In Meta while viewing your app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Select **Show** next to the **App secret** field.
1. The page prompts you to re-enter your Facebook account credentials. Once you do so, Meta shows the App Secret.
1. Highlight it to select it, copy it, and paste this into your n8n credential as the **App Secret**.
1. **Save** your n8n credential.

Refer to the [App Secret documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/security#appsecret){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

### App review

App Review requires Business Verification.

Your app must go through App Review if it will be used by someone who:

- Doesn't have a role on the app itself.
- Doesn't have a role in the Business that has claimed the app.

If your only app users are users who have a role on the app itself, App Review isn't required.

As part of the App Review process, you may need to request advanced access for your webhook subscriptions.

Refer to Meta's [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/resp-plat-initiatives/app-review){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Advanced Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/access-levels#advanced-access){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.

## Common issues

### Unverified apps limit

Facebook only lets you have a developer or administrator role on a maximum of 15 apps that aren't already linked to a Meta Verified Business Account.

Refer to [Limitations | Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app#limitations){:target=_blank .external-link} if you're over that limit."

- OAuth2: Use this method with [GitHub](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/) and [GitHub Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.githubtrigger/) nodes only; don't use with [GitHub Document Loader](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentgithubloader).

## Related resources

Refer to [GitHub's API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

There are two steps to setting up this credential:

1. [Generate a GitHub personal access token](#generate-personal-access-token).
2. [Set up the credential](#set-up-the-credential).

Refer to the sections below for detailed instructions.

### Generate personal access token

/// note | Recommended access token type
n8n recommends using a personal access token (classic). GitHub's fine-grained personal access tokens are still in beta and can't access all endpoints.
///

To generate your personal access token:

1. If you haven't done so already, verify your email address with GitHub. Refer to [Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
2. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile){:target=_blank .external-link}.
3. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps){:target=_blank .external-link}.
4. In the left navigation, under **Personal access tokens**, select **Tokens (classic)**.
5. Select **Generate new token > Generate new token (classic)**.
6. Enter a descriptive name for your token in the **Note** field, like `n8n integration`.
7. Select the **Expiration** you'd like for the token, or select **No expiration**.
8. Select **Scopes** for your token. For most of the n8n GitHub nodes, add the `repo` scope.
    - A token without assigned scopes can only access public information.
    - Refer to 
9. Select **Generate token**.
10. Copy the token.

Refer to [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. Refer to [Scopes for OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on GitHub scopes.

### Set up the credential

Then, in your n8n credential:

1. If you aren't using GitHub Enterprise Server, don't change the **GitHub server** URL.
    - If you're using [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server){:target=_blank .external-link}, update **GitHub server** to match the URL for your server.
2. Enter your **User** name as it appears in your GitHub profile.
3. Enter the **Access Token** you generated above.

## Using OAuth2

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cloud-oauth-button.md""

If you're [self-hosting n8n](/hosting/), create a new GitHub [OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps){:target=_blank .external-link}:

1. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Refer to [HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information relating to generic credential types.

/// note | Predefined credential types
n8n recommends using predefined credential types whenever there's a credential type available for the service you want to connect to. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

You can use [Predefined credential types](/integrations/custom-operations/#predefined-credential-types) to perform custom operations with some APIs where n8n has a node for the platform. For example, n8n has an Asana node, and supports using your Asana credentials in the HTTP Request node. Refer to [Custom operations](/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.

## Using OAuth1

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth1 authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

- An **Authorization URL**: Also known as the Resource Owner Authorization URI. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/authorize`. The temporary credentials are sent here to prompt a user to complete authorization.
- An **Access Token URL**: This is the URI used for the initial request for temporary credentials. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/request` or `/oauth1/token`.
- A **Consumer Key**: Also known as the client key, like a username. This specifies the `oauth_consumer_key` to use for the call.
- A **Consumer Secret**: Also known as the client secret, like a password.
- A **Request Token URL**: This is the URI used to switch from temporary credentials to long-lived credentials after authorization. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/access`.
- Select the **Signature Method** the auth handshake uses. This specifies the `oauth_signature_method` to use for the call. Options include:
	- **HMAC-SHA1**
	- **HMAC-SHA256**
	- **HMAC-SHA512**

For most OAuth1 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration to generate the values for most of these fields. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth1](https://oauth.net/1/){:target=_blank .external-link} and the [OAuth1 authorization flow](https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Using OAuth2

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth2 authentication.

Requirements to configure this credential depend on the **Grant Type** selected. Refer to [OAuth Grant Types](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/) for more information on each grant type.

For most OAuth2 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

### Authorization Code grant type

Use Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. The auth flow uses the redirect URL to return the user to the client. Then the application gets the authorization code from the URL and uses it to request an access token. Refer to [Authorization Code Request](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Authorization Code** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

- An **Authorization URL**
- An **Access Token URL**
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.
- _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
- _Optional:_ Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
	- **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
	- **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

### Client Credentials grant type

Use the Client Credentials grant type when applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user. Refer to [Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Client Credentials** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

- An **Access Token URL**: The URL to hit to begin the OAuth2 flow. Typically this URL ends in `/token`.
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to use to log in to the client.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in to the client.
- _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. Most services don't support scopes for Client Credentials grant types; only enter scopes here if yours does.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
	- **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
	- **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

### PKCE grant type

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant type is an extension to the Authorization Code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.

To configure this credential, select **PKCE** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

- An **Authorization URL**
- An **Access Token URL**
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.
- _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
- _Optional:_ Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
	- **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
	- **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

## Using query auth

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as a single key/value query parameter. (For multiple query parameters, use [Custom Auth](#using-custom-auth).)

To configure this credential, enter:

- A query parameter key or **Name**
- A query parameter **Value**

## Using custom auth

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as multiple key/value query parameters or you need more flexibility than the other generic auth options.

The **Custom Auth** credential expects JSON data to define your credential. You can use `headers`, `qs`, `body` or a mix. Review the examples below to get started.

### Sending two headers
```
{
	""headers"": {
		""X-AUTH-USERNAME"": ""username"",
		""X-AUTH-PASSWORD"": ""password""
	}
}
```

### Body
```
{
	 ""body"" : {
		""user"": ""username"",
		""pass"": ""password""
	}
}
```

### Query string
```
{
	""qs"": { 
		""appid"": ""123456"",
		""apikey"": ""my-api-key""
	}
}
```

### Sending header and query string
```
{
	""headers"": {
		""api-version"": ""202404""
	},
	""qs"": {
		""apikey"": ""my-api-key""
	}
}
```

## Provide an SSL certificate

You can send an SSL certificate with your HTTP request. Create the SSL certificate as a separate credential for use by the node:

1. In the HTTP Request node **Settings**, turn on **SSL Certificates**.
2. On the **Parameters** tab, add an existing SSL Certificate credential to **Credential for SSL Certificates** or create a new one.

To configure your SSL Certificates credential, you'll need to add:

- The Certificate Authority **CA** bundle
- The **Certificate** (CRT): May also appear as a Public Key, depending on who your issuing CA was and how they format the cert
- The **Private Key** (KEY)
- _Optional:_ If the **Private Key** is encrypted, enter a **Passphrase** for the private key.

If your SSL certificate is in a single file (such as a `.pfx` file), you'll need to open the file to copy details from it to paste into the appropriate fields:

- Enter the Public Key/CRT as the **Certificate**
- Enter the **Private Key**/KEY in that field"

- [Mattermost](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/)

## Supported authentication methods

- API access token

## Related resources

Refer to [Mattermost's API documentation](https://api.mattermost.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- A personal **Access Token**
- Your Mattermost **Base URL**.

To set it up:

1. In Mattermost, go to **Profile > Security > Personal Access Tokens**.

    /// warning | No Personal Access Tokens option
    If you don't see the Personal Access Tokens option, refer to the troubleshooting steps in [Enable personal access tokens](#enable-personal-access-tokens) below.
    ///

2. Select **Create Token**.
3. Enter a **Token description**, like `n8n integration`.
4. Select **Save**.
5. Copy the **Token ID** and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.
6. Enter your Mattermost URL as the **Base URL**.
7. By default, n8n connects only if SSL certificate validation succeeds. To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

Refer to the Mattermost [Personal access tokens documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Enable personal access tokens

Not seeing the **Personal Access Tokens** option has two possible causes:

- Mattermost doesn't have the personal access tokens integration enabled.
- You're trying to generate a personal access token as a non-admin user who doesn't have permission to generate personal access tokens.

To identify the root cause and resolve it:

1. Log in to Mattermost as an admin.
2. Go to **System Console > Integrations > Integration Management**.
3. Confirm that **Enable personal access tokens** is set to **true**. If it's not, change.
4. Go to **System Console > User Management > Users**.
5. Search for the user account you want to allow to generate personal access tokens.
6. Select the **Actions** dropdown for the user and select **Manage roles**.
7. Check the box for **Allow this account to generate personal access tokens** and **Save**.

Refer to the Mattermost [Personal access tokens documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information."

## Using OAuth2

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cloud-oauth-button.md""

Some Microsoft services require extra information for OAuth2. Refer to [Service-specific settings](#service-specific-settings) for more guidance on those services.

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

1. [Register an application](#register-an-application) with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
2. [Generate a client secret](#generate-a-client-secret) for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts){:target=_blank .external-link}. 

### Register an application

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select **Register an application**.
3. Enter a **Name** for your app.
4. In **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
5. In **Register an application**:
    1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
    2. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
    3. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
6. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

### Generate a client secret

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
1. In **Client secrets**, select **+ New client secret**.
1. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
1. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
1. If you see other fields in the n8n credential, refer to [Service-specific settings](#service-specific-settings) below for guidance on completing those fields.
1. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
1. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on adding a client secret.

### Service-specific settings

The following services require extra information for OAuth2:

#### Dynamics

Dynamics OAuth2 requires information about your Dynamics domain and region. Follow these extra steps to complete the credential:

1. Enter your Dynamics **Domain**.
2. Select the Dynamics data center **Region** you're within.

Refer to the [Microsoft Datacenter regions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/new-datacenter-regions){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on the region options and corresponding URLs.

#### Microsoft (general)

The general Microsoft OAuth2 also requires you to provide a space-separated list of **Scope**s for this credential.

Refer to [Scopes and permissions in the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc){:target=_blank .external-link} for a list of possible scopes.

#### Outlook

Outlook OAuth2 supports the credential accessing a user's primary email inbox or a shared inbox. By default, the credential will access a user's primary email inbox. To change this behavior:

1. Turn on **Use Shared Inbox**.
2. Enter the target user's UPN or ID as the **User Principal Name**.

#### SharePoint

SharePoint OAuth2 requires information about your SharePoint **Subdomain**.

To complete the credential, enter the **Subdomain** part of your SharePoint URL. For example, if your SharePoint URL is `https://tenant123.sharepoint.com`, the subdomain is `tenant123`."

# Microsoft SQL credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Microsoft SQL](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/)

## Prerequisites

Create a user account on a [Microsoft SQL server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/what-is-sql-server){:target=_blank .external-link} database.

## Supported authentication methods

- SQL database connection

## Related resources

Refer to [Microsoft's Connect to SQL Server documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/connect-to-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=sqldb#connect-to-sql-server){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about connecting to the service.

## Using SQL database connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **Server** name
- The **Database** name
- Your **User** account/ID
- Your **Password**
- The **Port** to use for the connection
- The **Domain** name
- Whether to use **TLS**
- Whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**
- The **Connect Timeout**
- The **Request Timeout**
- The **TDS Version** the connection should use

To set up the database connection:

1. Enter the SQL Server Host Name as the **Server**. In an existing SQL Server connection, the host name comes before the instance name in the format `HOSTNAME\INSTANCENAME`. Find the host name:
    - In the **Object Explorer** pane as the top-level object for your database.
    - In the footer of a query window.
    - Viewing the current connection **Properties** and looking for **Name** or **Display Name**.
    - Refer to [Find SQL Server Instance Name | When you're connected to SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#when-youre-connected-to-sql-server){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. You can also find the information in the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Enter the SQL Server Instance Name as the **Database** name. Find this name using the same steps listed above for finding the host name.
    - If you don't see an instance name in any of these places, then your database uses the default `MSSQLSERVER` instance name.
3. Enter your **User** account name or ID.
4. Enter your **Password**.
5. For the **Port**:
    - SQL Server defaults to `1433`.
    - If you can't connect over port 1433, check the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server){:target=_blank .external-link} for the phrase `Server is listening on` to identify the port number you should enter.
6. You only need to enter the **Domain** name if users in multiple domains access your database. Run this SQL query to get the domain name:

    ```sql
    SELECT DEFAULT_DOMAIN()[DomainName];
    ```

7. Select whether to use **TLS**.
8. Select whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**: If turned on, the credential will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.
9. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should attempt the initial connection to complete before disconnecting as the **Connect Timeout**. Refer to the [SqlConnection.ConnectionTimeout property documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectiontimeout){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
    - SQL Server stores this timeout as seconds, while n8n stores it as milliseconds. If you're copying your SQL Server defaults, multiple by 100 before entering the number here.
10. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should wait on a given request before timing out as the **Request Timeout**. This is basically a query timeout parameter. Refer to [Troubleshoot query time-out errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/performance/troubleshoot-query-timeouts#explanation){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
11. Select the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol to use from the **TDS Version** dropdown. If the server doesn't support the version you select here, the connection uses a negotiated alternate version. Refer to [Appendix A: Product Behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tds/135d0ebe-5c4c-4a94-99bf-1811eccb9f4a){:target=_blank .external-link} for a more detailed breakdown of the TDS versions' compatibility with different SQL Server versions and .NET frameworks. Options include:
    - **7_4 (SQL Server 2012 ~ 2019)**: TDS version 7.4.
    - **7_3_B (SQL Server 2008R2)**: TDS version 7.3.B.
    - **7_3_A (SQL Server 2008)**: TDS version 7.3.A.
    - **7_2 (SQL Server 2005)**: TDS version 7.2.
    - **7_1 (SQL Server 2000)**: TDS version 7.1."

# MQTT credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [MQTT](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtt/)
- [MQTT Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtttrigger/)

## Prerequisites

Install an [MQTT broker](https://mqtt.org/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

MQTT provides a list of Servers/Brokers at [MQTT Software](https://mqtt.org/software/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Supported authentication methods

- Broker connection

## Related resources

Refer to [MQTT's documentation](https://mqtt.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the MQTT protocol.

Refer to your broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration and details.

## Using broker connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- Your MQTT broker's **Protocol**
- The **Host**
- The **Port**
- A **Username** and **Password** to authenticate with
- If you're using **SSL**, the relevant certificates and keys

To set things up:

1. Select the broker's **Protocol**, which determines the URL n8n uses. Options include:
    - **Mqtt**: Begin the URL with the standard `mqtt:` protocol.
    - **Mqtts**: Begin the URL with the secure `mqtts:` protocol.
    - **Ws**: Begin the URL with the WebSocket `ws:` protocol.
2. Enter your broker **Host**.
3. Enter the **Port** number n8n should use to connect to the broker host.
4. Enter the **Username** to log into the broker as.
5. Enter that user's **Password**.
6. If you want to receive QoS 1 and 2 messages while offline, turn off the **Clean Session** toggle.
7. Enter a **Client ID** you'd like the credential to use. If you leave this blank, n8n will generate one for you. You can use a fixed or expression-based Client ID.
    - Client IDs can be useful to identify and track connection access. n8n recommends using something with `n8n` in it for easier auditing.
8. If your MQTT broker uses SSL, turn the **SSL** toggle on. Once you turn it on:
    1. Select whether to use **Passwordless** connection with certificates, which is like the SASL mechanism EXTERNAL. If turned on:
        1. Select whether to **Reject Unauthorized Certificate**: If turned off, n8n will connect even if the certificate validation fails.
        2. Add an SSL **Client Certificate**.
        3. Add an SSL **Client Key** for the Client Certificate.
    2. One or more SSL **CA Certificates**.

- [MySQL](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/)
- [Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent)

/// note | Agent node users
The Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels.
///

## Prerequisites

Create a user account on a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} server database.

## Supported authentication methods

- Database connection

## Related resources

Refer to [MySQL's documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using database connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The server **Host**: The database's host name or IP address.
- The **Database** name.
- A **User** name.
- A **Password** for that user.
- The **Port** number used by the MySQL server.
- **Connect Timeout**: The number of milliseconds during the initial database connection before a timeout occurs.
- **SSL**: If your database is using SSL, turn this on and add details for the SSL certificate.
- **SSH Tunnel**: Choose whether to connect over an SSH tunnel. An SSH tunnel lets un-encrypted traffic pass over an encrypted connection and enables authorized remote access to servers protected from outside connections by a firewall.

To set up your database connection credential:

1. Enter your database's hostname as the **Host** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the hostname:

    ```
    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'hostname';
    ```

2. Enter your database's name as the **Database** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the database name:

    ```
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

3. Enter the username of a **User** in the database. This user should have appropriate permissions for whatever actions you want n8n to perform.
4. Enter the **Password** for that user.
5. Enter the **Port** number used by the MySQL server (default is `3306`). Run this query to confirm the port number:

    ```
    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'port';
    ```

6. Enter the **Connect Timeout** you'd like the node to use. The Connect Timeout is the number of milliseconds during the initial database connection the node should wait before timing out. n8n defaults to `1000` which is the default used by MySQL of 10 seconds. If you want to match your database's `connect_timeout`, run this query to get it, then multiply by 100 before entering it in n8n:

    ```
    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'connect_timeout';
    ```

7. If your database uses SSL and you'd like to use **SSL** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. If you turn it on, enter the information from your MySQL SSL certificate in these fields:
    1. Enter the `ca.pem` file contents in the **CA Certificate** field.
    2. Enter the `client-key.pem` file contents in the **Client Private Key** field.
    3. Enter the `client-cert.pem` file contents in the **Client Certificate** field.
8. If you want to use **SSH Tunnel** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. Otherwise, skip it. If you turn it on:
    1. Select the **SSH Authenticate with** to set the SSH Tunnel type to build:
        - Select **Password** if you want to connect to SSH using a password.
        - Select **Private Key** if you want to connect to SSH using an identity file (private key) and a passphrase. 
    2. Enter the **SSH Host**. n8n uses this host to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
    3. Enter the **SSH Port**. n8n uses this port to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
    4. Enter the **SSH User** to connect with. n8n uses this user to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
    5. If you selected **Password** for **SSH Authenticate with**, add the **SSH Password**.
    6. If you selected **Private Key** for **SSH Authenticate with**:
        1. Add the contents of the **Private Key** or identity file used for SSH. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-file` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL.
        2. If the **Private Key** was created with a passphrase, enter that **Passphrase**. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-pass` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL. If the **Private Key** has no passphrase, leave this field blank.

### Share Notion page(s) with the integration

For your integration to interact with Notion, you must [give your integration page permission](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#give-your-integration-page-permissions){:target=_blank .external-link} to interact with page(s) in your Notion workspace:

1. Visit the page in your Notion workspace.
2. Select the triple dot menu at the top right of a page.
3. In **Connections**, select **Connect to**.
4. Use the search bar to find and select your integration from the dropdown list.

Once you share at least one page with the integration, you can start making API requests. If the page isn't shared, any API requests made will respond with an error.

Refer to [Integration permissions](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#integration-permissions){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated once you configure a public integration.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you configure a public integration.

You must [create a Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion){:target=_blank .external-link} and set it to public distribution:

1. Go to your Notion [integration dashboard](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations){:target=_blank .external-link}.

8. Turn on the **Do you want to make this integration public?** control.
9. Enter your company name and website in the **Organization Information** section.
10. Copy the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it to as a **Redirect URI** in the Notion integration's **OAuth Domain & URLs** section.
11. Go to the **Secrets** tab.
12. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to your n8n credential.

Refer to Notion's [public integration auth flow setup](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about authenticating to the service.

## Internal vs. public integrations

**Internal** integrations are:

* Specific to a single workspace.
* Accessible only to members of that workspace.
* Ideal for custom workspace enhancements.

Internal integrations use a simpler authentication process (the integration secret) and don't require any security review before publishing.

**Public** integrations are:

* Usable across multiple, unrelated Notion workspaces.
* Accessible by any Notion user, regardless of their workspace.
* Ideal for catering to broad use cases.

Public integrations use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. They require a Notion security review before publishing.

For a more detailed breakdown of the two integration types, refer to Notion's [Internal vs. Public Integrations documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started#internal-vs-public-integrations){:target=_blank .external-link}."

- [RabbitMQ](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmq/)
- [RabbitMQ Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmqtrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods

- User connection

## Related resources

Refer to [RabbitMQ's Connections documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/connections){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using user connection

To configure this credential, you'll need to have a [RabbitMQ broker](https://www.rabbitmq.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} installed and:

1. Enter the **Hostname** for the RabbitMQ broker.
2. Enter the **Port** the connection should use.
3. Enter a **User** the connection should use to log in as.
    - The default is `guest`. RabbitMQ recommends using a different user in production environments. Refer to [Access Control | The Basics](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#basics){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. If you're using the `guest` account with a non-localhost connection, refer to [`guest` user issues](#guest-user-issues) below for troubleshooting tips.
4. Enter the user's **Password**.
    - The default password for the `guest` user is `guest`.
5. Enter the [virtual host](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/vhosts){:target=_blank .external-link} the connection should use as the **Vhost**. The default virtual host is `/`.
6. Select whether the connection should use **SSL**. If turned on, also set:
    - **Passwordless**: Select whether the SSL certificate connection users SASL mechanism EXTERNAL (turned off) or doesn't use a password (turned on). If turned on, you'll also need to enter:
        - The **Client Certificate**: Paste the text of the SSL client certificate to use.
        - The **Client Key**: Paste the SSL client key to use.
        - The **Passphrase**: Paste the SSL passphrase to use.
    - **CA Certificates**: Paste the text of the SSL CA certificates to use.

## guest user issues

If you use the `guest` user for the credential and you try to access a remote host, you may see a connection error. The RabbitMQ logs show an error like this:

    [error] <0.918.0> PLAIN login refused: user 'guest' can only connect via localhost

This happens because RabbitMQ prohibits the default `guest` user from connecting from remote hosts. It can only connect over the `localhost`.

To resolve this error, you can:

- Update the `guest` user to allow it remote host access.
- Create or use a different user to connect to the remote host. The `guest` user is the only user limited by default.

Refer to [""guest"" user can only connect from localhost](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#loopback-users){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information."

# S3 credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [S3](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.s3/)

## Prerequisites

Create an account on an S3-compatible server. Use the S3 node for generic or non-AWS S3 like:

* [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}
* [MinIO](https://min.io/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}
* [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}

## Supported authentication methods

- S3 endpoint

## Related resources

Refer to your S3-compatible provider's documentation for more information on the services. For example, refer to [Wasabi's REST API documentation](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} or [DigitalOcean's Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}.

## Using S3 endpoint

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **S3 Endpoint**: Enter the URL endpoint for the S3 storage backend.
- A **Region**: Enter the region for your S3 storage. Some providers call this the ""region slug.""
- An **Access Key ID**: Enter the S3 access key your S3 provider uses to access the bucket or space. Some providers call this API keys.
- A **Secret Access Key**: Enter the secret access key for the **Access Key ID**.
- **Force Path Style**: When turned on, the connection uses path-style addressing for buckets.
- **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.

More detailed instructions for DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi follow. If you're using a different provider, refer to their documentation for more information. 

### Using DigitalOcean Spaces

To configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces:

1. In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open **Settings**. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend `https://` to that endpoint and enter it as the **S3 Endpoint** in n8n.
    - Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in.
2. For the **Region**, enter the region your bucket's located in, for example, `nyc3`.
    - If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter `us-east-1` instead.
3. From your DigitalOceans control panel, go to [**API**](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/spaces){:target=""_blank"" .external-link}.
4. Open the **Spaces Keys** tab.
5. Select **Generate New Key**.
6. Enter a **Name** for your key, like `n8n integration` and select the checkmark.
7. Copy the **Key** displayed next to the name and enter this as the **Access Key ID** in n8n.
8. Copy the **Secret** value and enter this as the **Secret Access Key** in n8n.
    - Refer to [Sharing Access to Buckets with Access Keys](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/manage-access/#access-keys){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} for more information on generating the key and secret.
9. Keep the **Force Path Style** toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format.
10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
    - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.
    - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

Refer to DigitalOcean's [Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} for more information.

### Using Wasabi

To configure the credential for use with Wasabi:

1. For the **S3 Endpoint**, enter the service URL for your bucket's region. Start it with `https://`.
    - Refer to [What are the service URLs for Wasabi's different storage regions?](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015106031-What-are-the-service-URLs-for-Wasabi-s-different-storage-regions){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} to identify the correct URL.
2. For the **Region**, enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered `https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com` as the **S3 Endpoint**, `us-east-2` is the region.
3. Log into you Wasabi Console as the root user.
4. Open the **Menu** and select **Access Keys**.
5. Select **CREATE NEW ACCESS KEY**.
6. Select whether the key is for the **Root User** or a **Sub-User** and select **CREATE**.
7. Copy the **Access Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Access Key ID**.
8. Copy the **Secret Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Secret Access Key**.
    - Refer to [Creating a Wasabi API Access Key Set](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019677192-Creating-a-Wasabi-API-Access-Key-Set){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} for more information on generating the key and secret.
9. Wasabi recommends turning on the **Force Path Style** toggle ""because the path-style offers the greatest flexibility in bucket names, avoiding domain name issues."" Refer to the Wasabi [REST API Introduction](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction){:target=""_blank"" .external-link} for more information.
10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
    - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.
    - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**."

# Salesforce credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Salesforce](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforce/)
- [Salesforce trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforcetrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods

- JWT
- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Salesforce's developer documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_intro.htm){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using JWT

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- Your **Environment Type** (Production or Sandbox)
- A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a connected app.
- Your Salesforce **Username**
- A **Private Key** for a self-signed digital certificate

To set things up, first you'll create a private key and certificate, then a connected app:

1. In n8n, select the **Environment Type** for your connection. Choose the option that best describes your environment from **Production** or **Sandbox**.
2. Enter your Salesforce **Username**.
1. Log in to your org in Salesforce.
2. You'll need a private key and certificate issued by a certification authority. Use your own key/cert or use OpenSSL to create a key and a self-signed digital certificate. Refer to the Salesforce [Create a Private Key and Self-Signed Digital Certificate documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_key_and_cert.htm){:target=_blank .external-link} for instructions on creating your own key and certificate.
3. From **Setup** in Salesforce, enter `App Manager` in the Quick Find box, then select **App Manager**.
3. On the App Manager page, select **New Connected App**.
4. Enter the required **Basic Info** for your connected app, including a **Name** and **Contact Email address**. Refer to Salesforce's [Configure Basic Connected App Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_basics.htm&type=5){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.
5. Check the box to **Enable OAuth Settings**.
6. For the **Callback URL**, enter `http://localhost:1717/OauthRedirect`.
7. Check the box to **Use digital signatures**.
8. Select **Choose File** and upload the file that contains your digital certificate, such as `server.crt`.
9. Add these **OAuth scopes**:
    - **Manage user data via APIs (api)**
    - **Manage user data via Web browsers (web)**
    - **Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)**
10. Select **Save**, then **Continue**. The **Manage Connected Apps** page should open to the app you just created.
11. In the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section, select **Manage Consumer Details**.
12. Copy the **Consumer Key** and add it to your n8n credential as the **Client ID**.
13. Enter the contents of the private key file in n8n as **Private Key**.

- A **Subdomain**: The subdomain for your servicenow instance is in your instance URL: `https://<subdomain>.service-now.com/`. For example, if the full URL is `https://dev99890.service-now.com`, then the subdomain is `dev99890`.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated once you register a new app.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you register a new app.
- A **Subdomain**: The subdomain for your servicenow instance is in your instance URL: `https://<subdomain>.service-now.com/`. For example, if the full URL is `https://dev99890.service-now.com`, then the subdomain is `dev99890`.

To generate your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, register a new app in **System OAuth > Application Registry > New > Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients**. Use these settings for your app:

- Copy the **Client ID** and add it to your n8n credential.
- Enter a **Client Secret** or leave it blank to automatically generate a random secret. Add this secret to your n8n credential.
- Copy the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it as a **Redirect URL**.

    - Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.

## Using API key

/// warning | Method deprecated
Shopify no longer generates API keys with passwords. Use the [Access token](#using-access-token) method instead.
///

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Key**
- A **Password**
- Your **Shop Subdomain**: Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.
- _Optional:_ A **Shared Secret**

## Common issues

Here are some common issues setting up the Shopify credential and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Enable custom app development

If you don't see the option to **Create a custom app**, no one's enabled custom app development for your store.

To enable custom app development, you must log in either as a store owner or as a user with the **Enable app development** permission:

1. In Shopify, go to **Admin > Settings >** [**Apps and sales channels**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/apps){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select **Develop apps**.
3. Select **Allow custom app development**.
4. Read the warning and information provided and select **Allow custom app development**.

### Forbidden credentials error

<!-- vale off -->
If you get a **Couldn't connect with these settings / Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials** warning when you test the credentials, this may be due to your app's [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} dependencies. For example, the `read_orders` scope also requires `read_products` scope. Review the scopes you have assigned and the action you're trying to complete.

11. In the **Scopes** section, select appropriate scopes for your app. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for a list of scopes.
13. After you've added scopes, go up to the **OAuth Tokens** section and select **Install to Workspace**. You must be a Slack workspace admin to complete this action.
14. Select **Allow**.
15. At this point, you should be able to select the OAuth button in your n8n credential to connect.

Refer to the Slack API [Quickstart](https://api.slack.com/quickstart){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. Refer to the Slack [Installing with OAuth](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more details on the OAuth flow itself.

## Scopes

Scopes determine what permissions an app has.

* If you want your app to act on behalf of users who authorize the app, add the required scopes under the **User Token Scopes** section.
* If you're building a bot, add the required scopes under the **Bot Token Scopes** section.

Here's the list of scopes the OAuth credential requires, which are a good starting point:

| **Scope name** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| `channels:read` | |
| `channels:write` | Not available as a bot token scope |
| `chat:write` | |
| `files:read` | |

# Strapi credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Strapi](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.strapi/)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Strapi](https://strapi.io/){:target=_blank .external-link} admin account with:

- Access to an existing Strapi project.
- At least one collection type within that project.
- Published data within that collection type.

Refer to the Strapi developer [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Supported authentication methods

- API user account: Requires a user account with appropriate content permissions.
- API token: Requires an admin account.

## Related resources

Refer to [Strapi's documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API user account

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A user **Email**: Must be for a user account, not an admin account. Refer to the more detailed instructions below.
- A user **Password**: Must be for a user account, not an admin account. Refer to the more detailed instructions below.
- The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.
    - For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`
- The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:
    - **Version 3**
    - **Version 4**

In Strapi, the configuration involves two steps:

1. [Configure a role](#configure-a-role).
2. [Create a user account](#create-a-user-account).

Refer to the more detailed instructions below for each step.

### Configure a role

For API access, use the Users & Permissions Plugin in **Settings > Users & Permissions Plugin**.

Refer to [Configuring Users & Permissions Plugin](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/configuring-users-permissions-plugin-settings){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on the plugin. Refer to [Configuring end-user roles](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on roles.

For the n8n credential, the user must have a role that grants them API permissions on the collection type. For the role, you can either:

* Update the default **Authenticated** role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Configuring role's permissions](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#configuring-roles-permissions){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
* Create a new role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Creating a new role](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#creating-a-new-role){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

For either option, once you open the role:

1. Go to the **Permissions** section.
2. Open the section for the relevant collection type.
3. Select the permissions for the collection type that the role should have. Options include:
    - `create` (POST)
    - `find` and `findone` (GET)
    - `update` (PUT)
    - `delete` (DELETE)
4. Repeat for all relevant collection types.
5. Save the role.

Refer to [Endpoints](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest#endpoints){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on the permission options.

### Create a user account

Now that you have an appropriate role, create an end-user account and assign the role to it:

1. Go to **Content Manager > Collection Types > User**.
2. Select **Add new entry**.
3. Fill in the user details. The n8n credential requires these fields, though your Strapi project may have more custom required fields:
    - **Username**: Required for all Strapi users.
    - **Email**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Email** in the n8n credential.
    - **Password**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Password** in the n8n credential.
    - **Role**: Select the role you set up in the previous step.

Refer to [Managing end-user accounts](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/managing-end-users){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.


## Using API token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Token**: Create an API token from **Settings > Global Settings > API Tokens**. Refer to Strapi's [Creating a new API token documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/API-tokens#creating-a-new-api-token){:target=_blank .external-link} for more details and information on regenerating API tokens.
    
    /// note | API tokens permission
    If you don't see the **API tokens** option in **Global settings**, your account doesn't have the **API tokens > Read** permission.
    ///
    
- The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.
    - For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`
- The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:
    - **Version 3**
    - **Version 4**"

## Prerequisites

- Create a [Strava](https://strava.com){:target=_blank .external-link} account.
- Create a Strava application in [**Settings > API**](https://www.strava.com/settings/api){:target=_blank .external-link}. Refer to [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Strava's API documentation](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated when you [create a Strava app](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#account){:target=_blank .external-link}.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you [create a Strava app](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#account){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Use these settings for your Strava app:

- In n8n, copy the **OAuth Callback URL**. Paste this URL into your Strava app's **Authorization Callback Domain**.
- Remove the protocol (`https://` or `http://`) and the relative URL (`/oauth2/callback` or `/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`) from the **Authorization Callback Domain**. For example, if the OAuth Redirect URL was originally `https://oauth.n8n.cloud/oauth2/callback`, the **Authorization Callback Domain** would be `oauth.n8n.cloud`.
- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your app and add them to your n8n credential.

Refer to [Authentication](https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about Strava's OAuth flow."

- [Stripe Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripetrigger/)
- [Stripe](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripe/)

## Supported authentication methods

- API key

## Related resources

Refer to [Stripe's API documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} admin or developer account and:

- An API **Secret Key**

Before you generate an API key, decide whether to generate it in live mode or test mode. Refer to [Test mode and live mode](#test-mode-and-live-mode) for more information about the two modes.

### Live mode Secret key

To generate a Secret key in live mode:

1. Open the [Stripe developer dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers){:target=_blank .external-link} and select [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. In the **Standard Keys** section, select **Create secret key**.
3. Enter a **Key name**, like `n8n integration`.
4. Select **Create**. The new API key displays.
4. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Secret Key**.

Refer to Stripe's [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

### Test mode Secret key

To use a Secret key in test mode, you must copy the existing one:

1. Go to your [Stripe test mode developer dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/developers){:target=_blank .external-link} and select [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. In the **Standard Keys** section, select **Reveal test key** for the **Secret key**.
3. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Secret Key**.

Refer to Stripe's [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Test mode and live mode

All Stripe API requests happen within either [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) or live mode. Each mode has its own API key. 

Use test mode to access simulated test data and live mode to access actual account data. Objects in one mode aren’t accessible to the other.

Refer to [API keys | Test mode versus live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about what's available in each mode and guidance on when to use each.

/// note | n8n credentials for both modes
If you want to work with both live mode and test mode keys, store each mode's key in a separate n8n credential.
///

## Key prefixes

Stripes' Secret keys always begin with `sk_`:

- Live keys begin with `sk_live_`.
- Test keys begin with `sk_test_`.

n8n hasn't tested these credentials with Restricted keys (prefixed `rk_`).

/// warning | Publishable keys
Don't use the Publishable keys (prefixed `pk_`) with your n8n credential.

# Twist credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Twist](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.twist/)

## Prerequisites

- Create a [Twist](https://twist.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.
- [Create a general integration](https://twist.com/app_console/create_app){:target=_blank .external-link} and configure a valid OAuth Redirect URL. Refer to [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Twist's API documentation](https://developer.twist.com/v3/#authorization){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about authenticating with the service.

## Using OAuth2
To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated once you create a general integration.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create a general integration.

To generate your Client ID and Client Secret, [create a general integration](https://twist.com/app_console/create_app){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Use these settings for your integration's **OAuth Authentication**:

- Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and enter it as the **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist.
    
    /// note | OAuth Redirect URL for self-hosted n8n
    Twist doesn't accept a `localhost` Redirect URL. The Redirect URL should be a URL in your domain, for example: `https://mytemplatemaker.example.com/gr_callback`. If your n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** contains localhost, refer below to [Local environment redirect URL](#local-environment-redirect-url) for generating a URL that Twist will allow.
    ///

- Select **Update OAuth settings** to save those changes.
- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Twist and enter them in the appropriate fields in n8n.

### Local environment redirect URL

Twist doesn't accept a localhost callback URL. These steps should allow you to configure the OAuth credentials for the local environment:

1. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server running on port `5678` to the internet. In your terminal, run the following command:
```sh
ngrok http 5678
```
2. Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace `<YOUR-NGROK-URL>` with the URL that you get from the previous step.
```sh
export WEBHOOK_URL=<YOUR-NGROK-URL>
```
3. Use the generated URL as your **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist."

## Prerequisites

- Create an [X developer](https://developer.x.com/en){:target=_blank .external-link} account.
- Create a [Twitter app](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/apps){:target=_blank .external-link} or use the default project and app created when you sign up for the developer portal. Refer to each supported authentication method below for more details on the app's configuration.

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

/// note | Deprecation warning
n8n used to support an **OAuth** authentication method, which used X's [OAuth 1.0a](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a){:target=_blank .external-link} authentication method. n8n deprecated this method with the release of V2 of the X node in n8n version [0.236.0](/release-notes/0-x/#n8n02360).
///

## Related resources

Refer to [X's API documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service. Refer to [X's API authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/overview){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about authenticating with the service.

Refer to [Application-only Authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about app-only authentication.

## Using OAuth2

Use this method if you're using n8n version 0.236.0 or later.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

To generate your Client ID and Client Secret:

1. In the Twitter [developer portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard){:target=_blank .external-link}, open your project.
2. On the project's **Overview** tab, find the **Apps** section and select **Add App**.
3. Give your app a **Name** and select **Next**.
1. Go to the **App Settings**.
4. In the **User authentication settings**, select **Set Up**.

5. In the **Type of app** section, select **Web App, Automated App or Bot**.
1. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**.
7. In your X app, find the **App Info** section and paste that URL in as the **Callback URI / Redirect URL**.
7. Add a **Website URL**.
8. Save your changes.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** displayed in X and add them to the corresponding fields in your n8n credential.

Refer to X's [OAuth 2.0 Authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on working with this authentication method.

/// note | X rate limits
This credential uses the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token authentication method, so you'll be subject to app rate limits. Refer to [X rate limits](#x-rate-limits) below for more information.
///

## X rate limits

X has time-based rate limits per endpoint based on your developer access plan level. X calculates app rate limits and user rate limits independently. Refer to [Rate limits](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits){:target=_blank .external-link} for the access plan level rate limits and guidance on avoiding hitting them.

Use the guidance below for calculating rate limits:

- If you're using the deprecated OAuth method, user rate limits apply. You'll have one limit per time window for each set of users' access tokens.
- If you're [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2), app rate limits apply. You'll have a limit per time window for requests made by your app.

X calculates user rate limits and app rate limits independently.

Refer to X's [Rate limits and authentication methods](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits#auth){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about these rate limit types."

# Wise credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Wise](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wise/)
- [Wise Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wisetrigger/)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Wise](https://wise.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API token

## Related resources

Refer to [Wise's API documentation](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/api-reference){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Token**: Go to your **user menu > Settings > API tokens** to generate an API token. Enter the generated API key in your n8n credential. Refer to [Getting started with the API](https://wise.com/help/articles/2958107/getting-started-with-the-api){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
- Your **Environment**: Select the environment that best matches your Wise account environment.
    - If you're using a Wise test sandbox account, select **Test**.
    - Otherwise, select **Live**.
- **Private Key (Optional)**: For live endpoints requiring Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), generate a public and private key. Enter the private key here. Refer to [Add a private key](#add-a-private-key) for more information.
    - If you're using a **Test** environment, you'll only need to enter a Private Key if you've enabled Strong Customer Authentication on the [public keys management page](https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/public-keys){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Add a private key

Wise protects some live endpoints and operations with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Refer to [Strong Customer Authentication & 2FA](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/features/strong-customer-authentication-2fa){:target=_blank .external-link} for details.

If you make a request to an endpoint that requires SCA, Wise returns a 403 Forbidden HTTP status code. The error returned will look like this:

> This request requires Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Please add a key pair to your account and n8n credentials. See https://api-docs.transferwise.com/#strong-customer-authentication-personal-token

To use endpoints requiring SCA, generate an RSA key pair and add the relevant key information to both Wise and n8n:

1. Generate an RSA key pair:

    ```sh
    $ openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048 
    $ openssl rsa -pubout -in private.pem -out public.pem
    ```

2. Add the content of the public key `public.pem` to your Wise **user menu > Settings > API tokens > Manage public keys**.
3. Add the content of the private key `private.pem` in n8n to the **Private Key (Optional)**.

Refer to [Personal Token SCA](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/features/strong-customer-authentication-2fa/personal-token-sca){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information."

# Google: OAuth2 generic

This document contains instructions for creating a generic OAuth2 Google credential for use with [custom operations](/integrations/custom-operations/).

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/managed-google-oauth.md""

## Prerequisites

* Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/){:targe=_blank .external-link} account.

## Set up OAuth

There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
1. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
1. [Configure your OAuth consent screen](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen).
1. [Create your Google OAuth client credentials](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials).
1. [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).

### Create a Google Cloud Console project

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the next section:

1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com){:target=_blank .external-link} using your Google credentials.
2. In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select **New project** or go directly to the [New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate){:target=_blank .external-link} page.
3. Enter a **Project name** and select the **Location** for your project.
4. Select **Create**.
5. Check the top navigation and make sure the **Select a project** dropdown has your project selected. If not, select the project you just created.

	<figcaption>Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation</figcaption>
	</figure>

### Enable APIs

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/enable-apis.md""

### Configure your OAuth consent screen

If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent){:target=_blank .external-link}:

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library){:target=_blank .external-link}. Make sure you're in the correct project.
	<figure markdown=""span"">
	![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)
	<figcaption>Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation</figcaption>
	</figure>
1. Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
2. For **User Type**, select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615#user-type&zippy=%2Cexternal%2Cinternal){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on user types.
3. Select **Create**.
4. Enter the essential information:
	- **App name**
	- **User support email**
	- **Email addresses** field in **Developer contact information**
5. In the **Authorized domains** section, add `n8n.cloud` if using n8n's Cloud service. If you're [self-hosting](/hosting/), add the domain of your n8n instance.
7. Select **SAVE AND CONTINUE** to go to the **Scopes** page.
8. You don't need to set any scopes. Select **SAVE AND CONTINUE** again to go to the **Summary** page.
9. On the **Summary** page, review the information for accuracy.

### Create your Google OAuth client credentials

Next, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:

1. In the **APIs & Services** section, select **Credentials**.
2. Select **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID**.
3. In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web application**.
4. Google automatically generates a **Name**. Update the **Name** to something you'll recognize in your console.
5. From your n8n credential, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**. Paste it into the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console.
6. Select **CREATE**.

### Finish your n8n credential

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

1. From Google's **OAuth client created** modal, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
2. From the same Google modal, copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
3. You must provide the scopes for this credential. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for more information. Enter multiple scopes in a space-separated list, for example:
	```
	https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose
	```
4. In n8n, select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.
5. **Save** your new credentials.

## Video

The following video demonstrates the steps described above:

</div>

## Scopes

Google services have one or more possible access scopes. A scope limits what a user can do. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} for a list of scopes for all services.

n8n doesn't support all scopes. When creating a generic Google OAuth2 API credential, you can enter scopes from the **Supported scopes** list below. If you enter a scope that n8n doesn't already support, it won't work.

# Google: Service Account

Using service accounts is more complex than OAuth2. Before you begin:

* Check if your node is [compatible](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/#compatible-nodes) with Service Account.
* Make sure you need to use Service Account. For most use cases, [OAuth2](/integrations/builtin-credentials/google/oauth-single-service/) is a better option.
* Read the Google documentation on [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Prerequisites

* Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/){:targe=_blank .external-link} account.

## Set up Service Account

There are four steps to connecting your n8n credential to a Google Service Account:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
1. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
1. [Set up Google Cloud Service Account](#set-up-google-cloud-service-account).
1. [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).

### Create a Google Cloud Console project

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the next section:

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/create-google-cloud-project.md""

### Enable APIs

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/enable-apis.md""

### Set up Google Cloud Service Account

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library){:target=_blank .external-link}. Make sure you're in the correct project.

	<figure markdown=""span"">
	![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)
	<figcaption>Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation</figcaption>
	</figure>

1. Select the hamburger menu **> APIs & Services > Credentials**. Google takes you to your **Credentials** page.
2. Select **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > Service account**.
3. Enter a name in **Service account name** and an ID in **Service account ID**. Refer to [Creating a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts?hl=en#creating){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
4. Select **CREATE AND CONTINUE**.
5. Based on your use-case, you may want to **Select a role** and **Grant users access to this service account**  using the corresponding sections.
6. Select **DONE**.
7. Select your newly created service account under the **Service Accounts** section. Open the **KEYS** tab.
8. Select **ADD KEY > Create new key**.
9. In the modal that appears, select **JSON**, then select **CREATE**. Google saves the file to your computer.

### Finish your n8n credential

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

1. Open the downloaded JSON file.
2. Copy the `client_email` and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Service Account Email**.
3. Copy the `private_key`. Don't include the surrounding `""` marks. Enter this as the **Private Key** in your n8n credential.

	///warning | Older versions of n8n
	If you're running an n8n version older than 0.156.0, replace all instances of `\n` in the JSON file with new lines.
	///

4. **Optional**: Choose if you want to [**Impersonate a User**](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority){:target=_blank .external-link} (turned on).
    1. To use this option, you must [Enable domain-wide delegation](#enable-domain-wide-delegation) for the service account as a Google Workspace super admin.
	1. Enter the **Email** of the user you want to impersonate.
5. If you plan to use this credential with the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, turn on **Set up for use in HTTP Request node**.
	1. With this setting turned on, you'll need to add **Scope(s)** for the node. n8n prepopulates some scopes. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
6. **Save** your credentials.

## Video

The following video demonstrates the steps described above.

</div>

## Troubleshooting

### Service Account can't access Google Drive files

A Service Account can't access Google Drive files and folders that weren't shared with its associated user email.

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com){:target=_blank .external-link} and copy your Service Account email.
2. Access your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com){:target=_blank .external-link} and go to the designated file or folder.
3. Right-click on the file or folder and select **Share**.
4. Paste your Service Account email into **Add People and groups**.
5. Select **Editor** for read-write access or **Viewer** for read-only access.

### Enable domain-wide delegation

To impersonate a user with a service account, you must enable domain-wide delegation for the service account.

/// warning | Not recommended
Google recommends you [avoid using domain-wide delegation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts#domain-wide-delegation){:target=_blank .external-link}, as it allows impersonation of any user (including super admins) and can pose a security risk.
///

To delegate domain-wide authority to a service account, you must be a super administrator for the Google Workspace domain. Then:

1. From your Google Workspace domain's [Admin console](https://admin.google.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}, select the hamburger menu, then select **Security > Access and data control > API Controls**.
2. In the **Domain wide delegation** pane, select **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.
3. Select **Add new**.
4. In the **Client ID** field, enter the service account's **Client ID**. To get the Client ID:
    * Open your Google Cloud Console project, then open the [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts){:target=_blank .external-link} page.
    * Copy the **OAuth 2 Client ID** and use this as the **Client ID** for the **Domain Wide Delegation**.
5. In the **OAuth scopes** field, enter a list of comma-separate scopes to grant your application access. For example, if your application needs domain-wide full access to the Google Drive API and the Google Calendar API, enter: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`.
6. Select **Authorize**.

It can take from 5 minutes up to 24 hours before you can impersonate all users in your Workspace."

# IMAP credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [IMAP Email](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.emailimap/)

## Prerequisites

Create an email account on a service with IMAP support.

## Supported authentication methods

- User account

## Related resources

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a standard protocol for receiving email. Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with IMAP; refer to your provider's IMAP instructions.

## Using user account

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **User** name: The email address you're retrieving email for.
- A **Password**: Either the password you use to check email or an app password. Your provider will tell you whether to use your own password or to generate an app password.
- A **Host**: The IMAP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `imap.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.
- A **Port** number: The default is port `993`. Use this port unless your provider or email administrator tells you to use something different.

Choose whether to use **SSL/TLS** and whether to **Allow Self-Signed Certificates**.

### Provider instructions

Refer to the quickstart guides for these common email providers.

#### Gmail

# Send Email credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Send Email](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/)

## Prerequisites

- Create an email account on a service that supports SMTP.
- Some email providers require that you enable or set up outgoing SMTP or generate an app password. Refer to your provider's documentation to see if there are other required steps.

## Supported authentication methods

- SMTP account

## Related resources

Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard protocol for sending and receiving email. Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with SMTP. Refer to your provider's SMTP instructions.

## Using SMTP account

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **User** email address
- A **Password**: This may be the user's password or an app password. Refer to the documentation for your email provider.
- The **Host**: The SMTP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `smtp.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.
- A **Port** number: The default is port `465`, commonly used for SSL. Other common ports are `587` for TLS or `25` for no encryption. Check with your provider.
- **SSL/TLS**: When turned on, SMTP will use SSL/TLS.
- **Disable STARTTLS**: When SSL/TLS is disabled, the SMTP server can still try to [upgrade the TCP connection using STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS){:target=_blank .external-link}. Turning this on prevents that behaviour.
- **Client Host Name**: If needed by your provider, add a client host name. This name identifies the client to the server.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Facebook Lead Ads Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production

Facebook Lead Ads only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Facebook Lead Ads overwrites the registered webhook URL. 

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Facebook Lead Ads will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

/// warning | Halts production traffic
This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.
///

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
3. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
4. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working."

* **Bot / App Mention**: The node triggers when your bot or app is [mentioned](https://slack.com/help/articles/205240127-Use-mentions-in-Slack){:target=_blank .external-link} in a channel the app is in.
* **File Made Public**: The node triggers when a file is [made public](https://slack.com/help/articles/4412651915539-Manage-public-file-sharing){:target=_blank .external-link}.
* **File Shared**: The node triggers when a file is [shared](https://slack.com/help/articles/201330736-Add-files-to-Slack){:target=_blank .external-link} in a channel the app is in.
* **New Message Posted to Channel**: The node triggers when a new message is posted to a channel the app is in.

* **Reaction Added**: The node triggers when a [reaction](https://slack.com/help/articles/202931348-Use-emoji-and-reactions){:target=_blank .external-link} is added to a message the app is added to.

## Parameters

Once you've set the events to trigger on, use the remaining parameters to further define the node's behavior:

* **Watch Whole Workspace**: Whether the node should watch for the selected **Events** in all channels in the workspace (turned on) or not (turned off, default).

    ///warning | Caution
    This will use one execution for every event in any channel your bot or app is in. Use with caution!
    ///

* **Channel to Watch**: Select the channel your node should watch for the selected **Events**. This parameter only appears if you don't turn on **Watch Whole Workspace**. You can select a channel:
    * **From list**: The node uses your credential to look up a list of channels in the workspace so you can select the channel you want.
    * **By ID**: Enter the ID of a channel you want to watch. Slack displays the channel ID at the bottom of the channel details with a one-click copy button.
    * **By URL**: Enter the URL of the channel you want to watch, formatted as `https://app.slack.com/client/<channel-address>`.
* **Download Files**: Whether to download files and use them in the node's output (turned on) or not (turned off, default). Use this parameter with the **File Made Public** and **File Shared** events.

## Options

You can further refine the node's behavior when you **Add Option**s:

* **Resolve IDs**: Whether to resolve the IDs to their respective names and return them (turned on) or not (turned off, default).
* **Usernames or IDs to ignore**: Select usernames or enter a comma-separated string of encoded user IDs to ignore events from. Choose from the list, or specify IDs using an [expression](/code/expressions/).

Refer to [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api){:target=_blank .external-link} for details about their API.

## Required scopes

To use this node, you need to create an application in Slack and enable event subscriptions. Refer to [Slack credentials | Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) for more information.

You must add the appropriate scopes to your Slack app for this trigger node to work.

The node requires scopes for the [conversations.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list){:target=blank .external-link} and [users.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list){:target=blank .external-link} methods at minimum. Check out the [Scopes | Slack credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#scopes) list for a more complete list of scopes.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Slack Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production

Slack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL. 

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

/// warning | Halts production traffic
This temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.
///

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
3. Edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL.
4. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
5. When you finish testing, edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL.
6. Toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

## Configure a webhook in TheHive

To configure the webhook for your TheHive instance:

1. Copy the testing and production webhook URLs from TheHive Trigger node.
2. Add the following lines to the `application.conf` file. This is TheHive configuration file:

	```
	notification.webhook.endpoints = [
		{
			name: TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME
			url: TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL
			version: 0
			wsConfig: {}
			includedTheHiveOrganisations: [""ORGANIZATION_NAME""]
			excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
		},
		{
			name: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME
			url: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL
			version: 0
			wsConfig: {}
			includedTheHiveOrganisations: [""ORGANIZATION_NAME""]
			excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
		}
	]
	```

3. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the URLs you copied in the previous step.
4. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME` with your preferred endpoint names.
5. Replace `ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.
6. Execute the following cURL command to enable notifications:
	```sh
	curl -XPUT -uTHEHIVE_USERNAME:THEHIVE_PASSWORD -H 'Content-type: application/json' THEHIVE_URL/api/config/organisation/notification -d '
	{
		""value"": [
			{
			""delegate"": false,
			""trigger"": { ""name"": ""AnyEvent""},
			""notifier"": { ""name"": ""webhook"", ""endpoint"": ""TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME"" }
			},
			{
			""delegate"": false,
			""trigger"": { ""name"": ""AnyEvent""},
			""notifier"": { ""name"": ""webhook"", ""endpoint"": ""PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME"" }
			}
		]
	}'

## Configure a webhook in TheHive

To configure the webhook for your TheHive instance:

1. Copy the testing and production webhook URLs from TheHive Trigger node.
2. Add the following lines to the `application.conf` file. This is TheHive configuration file:

	```
	notification.webhook.endpoints = [
		{
			name: TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME
			url: TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL
			version: 0
			wsConfig: {}
			includedTheHiveOrganisations: [""ORGANIZATION_NAME""]
			excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
		},
		{
			name: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME
			url: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL
			version: 0
			wsConfig: {}
			includedTheHiveOrganisations: [""ORGANIZATION_NAME""]
			excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
		}
	]
	```

3. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the URLs you copied in the previous step.
4. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME` with your preferred endpoint names.
5. Replace `ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.
6. Execute the following cURL command to enable notifications:
	```sh
	curl -XPUT -uTHEHIVE_USERNAME:THEHIVE_PASSWORD -H 'Content-type: application/json' THEHIVE_URL/api/config/organisation/notification -d '
	{
		""value"": [
			{
			""delegate"": false,
			""trigger"": { ""name"": ""AnyEvent""},
			""notifier"": { ""name"": ""webhook"", ""endpoint"": ""TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME"" }
			},
			{
			""delegate"": false,
			""trigger"": { ""name"": ""AnyEvent""},
			""notifier"": { ""name"": ""webhook"", ""endpoint"": ""PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME"" }
			}
		]
	}'

The model ID is the ID of any model in Trello. Depending on the use-case, it could be the User ID, List ID, and so on.

For this specific example, the List ID would be the Model ID:

1. Open the Trello board that contains the list.
2. If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.
3. Open the card, add `.json` at the end of the URL, and press enter.
4. In the JSON file, you will see a field called `idList`.
5. Copy `idList`and paste it in the **Model ID** field in n8n."

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the WhatsApp Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production

WhatsApp only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), WhatsApp overwrites the registered webhook URL. 

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. WhatsApp will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

/// warning | Halts production traffic
This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.
///

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
3. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
4. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working."

# Google Sheets Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Sheets Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheetstrigger/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event

When testing the Google Sheets Trigger node with the **Test step** or or **Test workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

## Date and time columns are rendering as numbers

Google Sheets can render dates and times a few different ways.

The [**serial number** format](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/DateTimeRenderOption), popularized by Lotus 1-2-3 and used my types of spreadsheet software, represents dates as a decimal number. The whole number component (the part left of the decimal) represents the number of days since December 30, 1899. The decimal portion (the part right of the decimal) represents time as a portion of a 24-hour period (for example, `.5` represents noon).

To use a different format for date and time values, adjust the format in your Google Sheet Trigger node. This is available when **Trigger On** is set to **Row Added**:

1. Open the Google Sheet Trigger node on your canvas.
2. Select **Add option**.
3. Select **DateTime Render**.
4. Change **DateTime Render** to **Formatted String**.

The Google Sheets Trigger node will now format date, time, datetime, and duration fields as strings according to their number format.

The number format depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings. You can change the local by opening the spreadsheet and selecting **File > Settings**. In the **General** tab, set **Locale** to your preferred locale. Select **Save settings** to adjust the value."

# Telegram Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event

When testing the Telegram Trigger node with the **Test step** or or **Test workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

<!-- vale off -->
## Bad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook
<!-- vale on -->

This error occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy and there is a problem with your instance's webhook URL.

When running n8n behind a reverse proxy, you must [configure the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) with the public URL where your n8n instance is running. For Telegram, this URL must use HTTPS.

To fix this issue, configure TLS/SSL termination in your reverse proxy. Afterward, update your `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable to use the HTTPS address.

## Workflow only works in testing or production

Telegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL. 

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production.

To create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference [Telegram's bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and the [Telegram bot API reference](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for more information.

To disable your workflow when testing, try the following:

/// warning | Halts production traffic
This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.
///

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
3. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
4. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working."

n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes. You can't install any node on this list.

n8n may add community nodes to the blocklist for a range of reasons, including:

* The node is intentionally malicious
* It's low quality (low enough to be harmful)

# Risks when using community nodes

Using community nodes means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.

Risks include:

* System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.
* Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.
* Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.

## Report bad community nodes

<!-- vale off -->

You can report bad community nodes to [security@n8n.io](mailto: security@n8n.io)

## Disable community nodes

You can disable community nodes by setting `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED` to `false`."

# Troubleshooting and errors

## Error: Missing packages

n8n installs community nodes directly onto the hard disk. The files must be available at startup for n8n to load them. If the packages aren't available at startup, you get an error warning of missing packages.

If running n8n using Docker: depending on your Docker setup, you may lose the packages when you recreate your container or upgrade your n8n version. You must either:

* Persist the contents of the `~/.n8n/nodes` directory. This is the best option. If you follow the [Docker installation](/hosting/installation/docker/) guide, the setup steps include persisting this directory.
* Set the `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES` environment variable to `true`.

The second option might increase startup time and may cause health checks to fail."

# Using community nodes

To use community nodes, you first need to [install](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) them.

## Adding community nodes to your workflow

After installing a community node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the **Nodes** panel. n8n marks community nodes with a **Package** <span class=""inline-image"">![Package icon](/_images/common-icons/package.png){.off-glb}</span> icon in the nodes panel.

## Community nodes with duplicate names

It's possible for several community nodes to have the same name. If you use two nodes with the same name in your workflow, they'll look the same, unless they have different icons."

# Build a declarative-style node

This tutorial walks through building a declarative-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/prerequisites.md""

You need some understanding of:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- REST APIs
- git

## Build your node

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/){:target=_blank .external-link}. You'll create a node that uses two of NASA's services: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Mars Rover Photos. To keep the code examples short, the node won't implement every available option for the Mars Rover Photos endpoint.

/// note | Existing node
n8n has a built-in NASA node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.
///
### Step 1: Set up the project


n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter. 

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.
2. Clone your new repository:
		```shell
		git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-nasa-pics
		cd n8n-nodes-nasa-pics
		```

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

* `nodes/ExampleNode`
* `nodes/HTTPBin`
* `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
* `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/NasaPics`  
`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.json`  
`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.ts`  
`credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`  

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

```shell
npm i
```

### Step 2: Add an icon

Save the NASA SVG logo from [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg){:target=_blank .external-link} as `nasapics.svg` in `nodes/NasaPics/`.


--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/node-icons.md""


### Step 3: Create the node

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports

Start by adding the import statements:

```typescript
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';
```

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class

The node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

/// note | Class names and file names
Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `NasaPics`, the filename must be `NasaPics.node.ts`.
///
```typescript
export class NasaPics implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		// Basic node details will go here
		properties: [
		// Resources and operations will go here
		]
	};
}
```

#### Step 3.3: Add node details

All nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name, icon, and the basic information for making a request using the node. Add the following to the `description`:

```typescript
displayName: 'NASA Pics',
name: 'NasaPics',
icon: 'file:nasapics.svg',
group: ['transform'],
version: 1,
subtitle: '={{$parameter[""operation""] + "": "" + $parameter[""resource""]}}',
description: 'Get data from NASAs API',
defaults: {
	name: 'NASA Pics',
},
inputs: ['main'],
outputs: ['main'],
credentials: [
	{
		name: 'NasaPicsApi',
		required: true,
	},
],
requestDefaults: {
	baseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov',
	headers: {
		Accept: 'application/json',
		'Content-Type': 'application/json',
	},
},
```

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, `description`, and `subtitle`.

#### Step 3.4: Add resources

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access two of NASA's API endpoints: `planetary/apod` and `mars-photos`. This means you need to define two resource options in `NasaPics.node.ts`. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

```typescript
properties: [
	{
		displayName: 'Resource',
		name: 'resource',
		type: 'options',
		noDataExpression: true,
		options: [
			{
				name: 'Astronomy Picture of the Day',
				value: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
			},
			{
				name: 'Mars Rover Photos',
				value: 'marsRoverPhotos',
			},
		],
		default: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
	},
	// Operations will go here

]
```

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

In a declarative-style node, the operations object includes `routing` (within the `options` array). This sets up the details of the API call.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Operation',
	name: 'operation',
	type: 'options',
	noDataExpression: true,
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Get',
			value: 'get',
			action: 'Get the APOD',
			description: 'Get the Astronomy Picture of the day',
			routing: {
				request: {
					method: 'GET',
					url: '/planetary/apod',
				},
			},
		},
	],
	default: 'get',
},
{
	displayName: 'Operation',
	name: 'operation',
	type: 'options',
	noDataExpression: true,
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'marsRoverPhotos',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Get',
			value: 'get',
			action: 'Get Mars Rover photos',
			description: 'Get photos from the Mars Rover',
			routing: {
				request: {
					method: 'GET',
				},
			},
		},
	],
	default: 'get',
},
{
	displayName: 'Rover name',
	description: 'Choose which Mars Rover to get a photo from',
	required: true,
	name: 'roverName',
	type: 'options',
	options: [
		{name: 'Curiosity', value: 'curiosity'},
		{name: 'Opportunity', value: 'opportunity'},
		{name: 'Perseverance', value: 'perseverance'},
		{name: 'Spirit', value: 'spirit'},
	],
	routing: {
		request: {
			url: '=/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/{{$value}}/photos',
		},
	},
	default: 'curiosity',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'marsRoverPhotos',
			],
		},
	},
},
{
	displayName: 'Date',
	description: 'Earth date',
	required: true,
	name: 'marsRoverDate',
	type: 'dateTime',
	default:'',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'marsRoverPhotos',
			],
		},
	},
	routing: {
		request: {
			// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string
			qs: {
				earth_date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}',
			},
		},
	},
},
// Optional/additional fields will go here
```

This code creates two operations: one to get today's APOD image, and another to send a get request for photos from one of the Mars Rovers. The object named `roverName` requires the user to choose which Rover they want photos from. The `routing` object in the Mars Rover operation references this to create the URL for the API call.

#### Step 3.6: Optional fields

Most APIs, including the NASA API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add one additional field, to allow users to pick a date to use with the APOD endpoint. Add the following to the properties array:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Additional Fields',
	name: 'additionalFields',
	type: 'collection',
	default: {},
	placeholder: 'Add Field',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
			],
			operation: [
				'get',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			displayName: 'Date',
			name: 'apodDate',
			type: 'dateTime',
			default: '',
			routing: {
				request: {
					// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string
					qs: {
						date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}',
					},
				},
			},
		},
	],									
}
```


### Step 4: Set up authentication

The NASA API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `nasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`:

```typescript
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class NasaPicsApi implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'NasaPicsApi';
	displayName = 'NASA Pics API';
	// Uses the link to this tutorial as an example
	// Replace with your own docs links when building your own nodes
	documentationUrl = 'https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'API Key',
			name: 'apiKey',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];
	authenticate = {
		type: 'generic',
		properties: {
			qs: {
				'api_key': '={{$credentials.apiKey}}'
			}
		},
	} as IAuthenticateGeneric;
}
```

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/).


### Step 5: Add node metadata

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

```json
{
	""node"": ""n8n-nodes-base.NasaPics"",
	""nodeVersion"": ""1.0"",
	""codexVersion"": ""1.0"",
	""categories"": [
		""Miscellaneous""
	],
	""resources"": {
		""credentialDocumentation"": [
			{
				""url"": """"
			}
		],
		""primaryDocumentation"": [
			{
				""url"": """"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

For more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/).

### Step 6: Update the npm package details

Your npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:

```json
{
	// All node names must start with ""n8n-nodes-""
	""name"": ""n8n-nodes-nasapics"",
	""version"": ""0.1.0"",
	""description"": ""n8n node to call NASA's APOD and Mars Rover Photo services."",
	""keywords"": [
		// This keyword is required for community nodes
		""n8n-community-node-package""
	],
	""license"": ""MIT"",
	""homepage"": ""https://n8n.io"",
	""author"": {
		""name"": ""Test"",
		""email"": ""test@example.com""
	},
	""repository"": {
		""type"": ""git"",
		// Change the git remote to your own repository
		// Add the new URL here
		""url"": ""git+<your-repo-url>""
	},
	""main"": ""index.js"",
	""scripts"": {
		// don't change
	},
	""files"": [
		""dist""
	],
	// Link the credentials and node
	""n8n"": {
		""n8nNodesApiVersion"": 1,
		""credentials"": [
			""dist/credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.js""
		],
		""nodes"": [
			""dist/nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.js""
		]
	},
	""devDependencies"": {
		// don't change
	},
	""peerDependencies"": {
		// don't change
	}
}
```

You need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json){:target=_blank .external-link}.

# Set up your development environment

This document lists the essential dependencies for developing a node, as well as guidance on setting up your editor.

## Requirements

To build and test a node, you need: 

* Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm){:target=_blank class=.external-link}. For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows){:target=_blank class=.external-link}.
* A local instance of n8n. You can install n8n with `npm install n8n -g`, then follow the steps in [Run your node locally](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/run-node-locally/) to test your node.

You should also have [git](https://git-scm.com/){:target=_blank class=.external-link} installed. This allows you to clone and use the [n8n-node-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter){:target=_blank class=.external-link}.

## Editor setup

n8n recommends using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target=_blank class=.external-link} as your editor.

Install these extensions:

* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint){:target=_blank class=.external-link}
* [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig){:target=_blank class=.external-link}
* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode){:target=_blank class=.external-link}

By using VS Code and these extensions, you get access to the n8n node linter's warnings as you code."

# Build a programmatic-style node

This tutorial walks through building a programmatic-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/prerequisites.md""

You need some understanding of:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- REST APIs
- git
- Expressions in n8n


## Build your node

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}. You'll create a node that implements one piece of SendGrid functionality: create a contact.

/// note | Existing node
n8n has a built-in SendGrid node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.
///
### Step 1: Set up the project

n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter. 

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate){:target=_blank .external-link} from the template repository.
2. Clone your new repository:
		```shell
		git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-friendgrid
		cd n8n-nodes-friendgrid
		```

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

* `nodes/ExampleNode`
* `nodes/HTTPBin`
* `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
* `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/FriendGrid`  
`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.json`  
`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts`  
`credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`  

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

```shell
npm i
```

### Step 2: Add an icon

Save the SendGrid SVG logo from [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/SendGrid/sendGrid.svg){:target=_blank .external-link} as `friendGrid.svg` in `nodes/FriendGrid/`.


--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/node-icons.md""


### Step 3: Define the node in the base file

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports

Start by adding the import statements:

```typescript
import {
	IExecuteFunctions,
} from 'n8n-core';

import {
	IDataObject,
	INodeExecutionData,
	INodeType,
	INodeTypeDescription,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

import {
	OptionsWithUri,
} from 'request';
```

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class

The node must export an interface that implements `INodeType`. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

/// note | Class names and file names
Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `FriendGrid`, the filename must be `FriendGrid.node.ts`.
///
```typescript
export class FriendGrid implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		// Basic node details will go here
		properties: [
			// Resources and operations will go here
		],
	};
	// The execute method will go here
	async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
	}
}
```

#### Step 3.3: Add node details

All programmatic nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name and icon. Add the following to the `description`:

```typescript
displayName: 'FriendGrid',
name: 'friendGrid',
icon: 'file:friendGrid.svg',
group: ['transform'],
version: 1,
description: 'Consume SendGrid API',
defaults: {
	name: 'FriendGrid',
},
inputs: ['main'],
outputs: ['main'],
credentials: [
	{
		name: 'friendGridApi',
		required: true,
	},
],
```

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, and `description`.

#### Step 3.4: Add the resource

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access one of SendGrid's API endpoints: `/v3/marketing/contacts`. This means you need to define a resource for this endpoint. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Resource',
	name: 'resource',
	type: 'options',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Contact',
			value: 'contact',
		},
	],
	default: 'contact',
	noDataExpression: true,
	required: true,
	description: 'Create a new contact',
},
```

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations

The operations object defines what you can do with a resource. It usually relates to REST API verbs (GET, POST, and so on). In this tutorial, there's one operation: create a contact. It has one required field, the email address for the contact the user creates.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Operation',
	name: 'operation',
	type: 'options',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'contact',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Create',
			value: 'create',
			description: 'Create a contact',
			action: 'Create a contact',
		},
	],
	default: 'create',
	noDataExpression: true,
},
{
	displayName: 'Email',
	name: 'email',
	type: 'string',
	required: true,
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			operation: [
				'create',
			],
			resource: [
				'contact',
			],
		},
	},
	default:'',
	placeholder: 'name@email.com',
	description:'Primary email for the contact',
},
```

#### Step 3.6: Add optional fields

Most APIs, including the SendGrid API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add two additional fields, to allow users to enter the contact's first name and last name. Add the following to the properties array:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Additional Fields',
	name: 'additionalFields',
	type: 'collection',
	placeholder: 'Add Field',
	default: {},
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'contact',
			],
			operation: [
				'create',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			displayName: 'First Name',
			name: 'firstName',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
		{
			displayName: 'Last Name',
			name: 'lastName',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	],
},
```

### Step 4: Add the execute method

You've set up the node UI and basic information. It's time to map the node UI to API requests, and make the node actually do something.

The `execute` method runs every time the node runs. In this method, you have access to the input items and to the parameters that the user set in the UI, including the credentials.

Add the following the `execute` method in the `FriendGrid.node.ts`:

```typescript
// Handle data coming from previous nodes
const items = this.getInputData();
let responseData;
const returnData = [];
const resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string;
const operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string;

// For each item, make an API call to create a contact
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	if (resource === 'contact') {
		if (operation === 'create') {
			// Get email input
			const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string;
			// Get additional fields input
			const additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', i) as IDataObject;
			const data: IDataObject = {
				email,
			};

			Object.assign(data, additionalFields);

			// Make HTTP request according to https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/
			const options: OptionsWithUri = {
				headers: {
					'Accept': 'application/json',
				},
				method: 'PUT',
				body: {
					contacts: [
						data,
					],
				},
				uri: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`,
				json: true,
			};
			responseData = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(this, 'friendGridApi', options);
			returnData.push(responseData);
		}
	}
}
// Map data to n8n data structure
return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(returnData)];
```

Note the following lines of this code:

```typescript
const items = this.getInputData();
... 
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	...
	const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string;
	...
}
```

Users can provide data in two ways:

* Entered directly in the node fields
* By mapping data from earlier nodes in the workflow

`getInputData()`, and the subsequent loop, allows the node to handle situations where data comes from a previous node. This includes supporting multiple inputs. This means that if, for example, the previous node outputs contact information for five people, your FriendGrid node can create five contacts.


### Step 5: Set up authentication

The SendGrid API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`

```typescript
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,
	ICredentialTestRequest,
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class FriendGridApi implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'friendGridApi';
	displayName = 'FriendGrid API';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'API Key',
			name: 'apiKey',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];

	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
		type: 'generic',
		properties: {
			headers: {
				Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.apiKey}}',
			},
		},
	};

	test: ICredentialTestRequest = {
		request: {
			baseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3',
			url: '/marketing/contacts',
		},
	};
}

```

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/).

### Step 6: Add node metadata

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

```json
{
	""node"": ""n8n-nodes-base.FriendGrid"",
	""nodeVersion"": ""1.0"",
	""codexVersion"": ""1.0"",
	""categories"": [
		""Miscellaneous""
	],
	""resources"": {
		""credentialDocumentation"": [
			{
				""url"": """"
			}
		],
		""primaryDocumentation"": [
			{
				""url"": """"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

For more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/).


### Step 7: Update the npm package details

Your npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:

```json
{
	// All node names must start with ""n8n-nodes-""
	""name"": ""n8n-nodes-friendgrid"",
	""version"": ""0.1.0"",
	""description"": ""n8n node to create contacts in SendGrid"",
	""keywords"": [
		// This keyword is required for community nodes
		""n8n-community-node-package""
	],
	""license"": ""MIT"",
	""homepage"": ""https://n8n.io"",
	""author"": {
		""name"": ""Test"",
		""email"": ""test@example.com""
	},
	""repository"": {
		""type"": ""git"",
		// Change the git remote to your own repository
		// Add the new URL here
		""url"": ""git+<your-repo-url>""
	},
	""main"": ""index.js"",
	""scripts"": {
		// don't change
	},
	""files"": [
		""dist""
	],
	// Link the credentials and node
	""n8n"": {
		""n8nNodesApiVersion"": 1,
		""credentials"": [
			""dist/credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.js""
		],
		""nodes"": [
			""dist/nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.js""
		]
	},
	""devDependencies"": {
		// don't change
	},
	""peerDependencies"": {
		// don't change
	}
}
```

You need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json){:target=_blank .external-link}.



## Test your node

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/testing.md""

## Next steps

* [Deploy your node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/).
* View an example of a programmatic node: n8n's [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost){:target=_blank .external-link}. This is an example of a more complex programmatic node structure.
* Learn about [node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/).
* Make sure you understand key concepts: [item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) and [data structures](/data/data-structure/)."

# Code standards

Following defined code standards when building your node makes your code more readable and maintainable, and helps avoid errors. This document provides guidance on good code practices for node building. It focuses on code details. For UI standards and UX guidance, refer to [Node UI design](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design/).

## Use the linter

The n8n node linter provides automatic checking for many of the node-building standards. You should ensure your node passes the linter's checks before publishing it. Refer to the [n8n node linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter/) documentation for more information.

## Use the starter

The n8n node starter project includes a recommended setup, dependencies (including the linter), and examples to help you get started. Begin new projects with the [starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Write in TypeScript

All n8n code is TypeScript. Writing your nodes in TypeScript can speed up development and reduce bugs.

## Detailed guidelines for writing a node

These guidelines apply to any node you build. 

### Resources and operations

If your node can perform several operations, call the parameter that sets the operation `Operation`. If your node can do these operations on more than one resource, create a `Resource` parameter. The following code sample shows a basic resource and operations setup:

```js
export const ExampleNode implements INodeType {
    description: {
        displayName: 'Example Node',
        ...
        properties: [
            {
                displayName: 'Resource',
                name: 'resource',
                type: 'options',
                options: [
                    {
                        name: 'Resource One',
                        value: 'resourceOne'
                    },
                    {
                        name: 'Resource Two',
                        value: 'resourceTwo'
                    }
                ],
                default: 'resourceOne'
            },
            {
                displayName: 'Operation',
                name: 'operation',
                type: 'options',
                // Only show these operations for Resource One
                displayOptions: {
                    show: {
                        resource: [
                            'resourceOne'
                        ]
                    }
                },
                options: [
                    {
                        name: 'Create',
                        value: 'create',
                        description: 'Create an instance of Resource One'
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Reuse internal parameter names

All resource and operation fields in an n8n node have two settings: a display name, set using the `name` parameter, and an internal name, set using the `value` parameter. Reusing the internal name for fields allows n8n to preserve user-entered data if a user switches operations. 

For example: you're building a node with a resource named 'Order'. This resource has several operations, including Get, Edit, and Delete. Each of these operations uses an order ID to perform the operation on the specified order. You need to display an ID field for the user. This field has a display label, and an internal name. By using the same internal name (set in `value`) for the operation ID field on each resource, a user can enter the ID with the Get operation selected, and not lose it if they switch to Edit.

When reusing the internal name, you must ensure that only one field is visible to the user at a time. You can control this using `displayOptions`.

## Detailed guidelines for writing a programmatic-style node

These guidelines apply when building nodes using the programmatic node-building style. They aren't relevant when using the declarative style. For more information on different node-building styles, refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/).

### Don't change incoming data

Never change the incoming data a node receives (data accessible with `this.getInputData()`) as all nodes share it. If you need to add, change, or delete data, clone the incoming data and return the new data. If you don't do this, sibling nodes that execute after the current one will operate on the altered data and process incorrect data.

It's not necessary to always clone all the data. For example, if a node changes the binary data but not the JSON data, you can create a new item that reuses the reference to the JSON item.


### Use the built in request library

Some third-party services have their own libraries on npm, which make it easier to create an integration. The problem with these packages is that you add another dependency (plus all the dependencies of the dependencies). This adds more and more code, which has to be loaded, can introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, and so on. Instead, use the built-in module:

```typescript
// If no auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);

// If auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call(
	this, 
	'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi
	options,
);
```

This uses the npm package [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios){:target=_blank .external-link}.

# Credentials file

The credentials file defines the authorization methods for the node. The settings in this file affect what n8n displays in the **Credentials** modal, and must reflect the authentication requirements of the service you're connecting to.

In the credentials file, you can use all the [n8n UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/). n8n encrypts the data that's stored using credentials using an encryption key.

## Structure of the credentials file

The credentials file follows this basic structure:

1. Import statements
2. Create a class for the credentials
3. Within the class, define the properties that control authentication for the node.

### Outline structure

```js
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,
	ICredentialTestRequest,
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'exampleNodeApi';
	displayName = 'Example Node API';
	documentationUrl = '';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'API Key',
			name: 'apiKey',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];
	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
		type: 'generic',
		properties: {
    		// Can be body, header, qs or auth
			qs: {
        		// Use the value from `apiKey` above
				'api_key': '={{$credentials.apiKey}}'
			}

		},
	};
	test: ICredentialTestRequest = {
		request: {
			baseURL: '={{$credentials?.domain}}',
			url: '/bearer',
		},
	};
}
```


## Parameters

### `name`

String. The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.

### `displayName`

String. The name n8n uses in the GUI.

### `documentationUrl`

String. URL to your credentials documentation.

### `properties`

Each object contains:

* `displayName`: the name n8n uses in the GUI.
* `name`: the internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.
* `type`: the data type expected, such as `string`.
* `default`: the URL that n8n should use to test credentials.

### `authenticate`

* `authenticate`: Object. Contains objects that tell n8n how to inject the authentication data as part of the API request. 

#### `type`

String. If you're using an authentication method that sends data in the header, body, or query string, set this to `'generic'`. 

#### `properties`

Object. Defines the authentication methods. Options are:

* `body`: Object. Sends authentication data in the request body. Can contain nested objects.
```typescript
authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
	type: 'generic',
	properties: {
		body: {
			username: '={{$credentials.username}}',
			password: '={{$credentials.password}}',
		},
	},
};
``` 

* `header`: Object. Send authentication data in the request header.
```typescript
authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
	type: 'generic',
	properties: {
		header: {
			Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.authToken}}',
		},
	},
};
``` 

* `qs`: Object. Stands for ""query string."" Send authentication data in the request query string.
```typescript
authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
	type: 'generic',
	properties: {
		qs: {
			token: '={{$credentials.token}}',
		},
	},
};
``` 

* `auth`: Object. Used for Basic Auth. Requires `username` and `password` as the key names.
```typescript
authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
	type: 'generic',
	properties: {
		auth: {
			username: '={{$credentials.username}}',
			password: '={{$credentials.password}}',
		},
	},
};
```

### `test`

Provide a `request` object containing a URL and authentication type that n8n can use to test the credential.

```typescript
test: ICredentialTestRequest = {
		request: {
			baseURL: '={{$credentials?.domain}}',
			url: '/bearer',
		},
	};
```"

# HTTP request helper for node builders

n8n provides a flexible helper for making HTTP requests, which abstracts away most of the complexity.

/// note | Programmatic style only
The information in this document is for node building using the programmatic style. It doesn't apply to declarative style nodes.
///
## Usage

Call the helper inside the `execute` function. 

```typescript
// If no auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);

// If auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call(
	this, 
	'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi
	options,
);
```

`options` is an object:

```typescript
{
	url: string;
	headers?: object;
	method?: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'HEAD';
	body?: FormData | Array | string | number | object | Buffer | URLSearchParams;
	qs?: object;
	arrayFormat?: 'indices' | 'brackets' | 'repeat' | 'comma';
	auth?: {
		username: string,
		password: string,
	};
	disableFollowRedirect?: boolean;
	encoding?: 'arraybuffer' | 'blob' | 'document' | 'json' | 'text' | 'stream';
	skipSslCertificateValidation?: boolean;
	returnFullResponse?: boolean;
	proxy?: {
		host: string;
		port: string | number;
		auth?: {
			username: string;
			password: string;
		},
		protocol?: string;
	};
	timeout?: number;
	json?: boolean;
}	
```

`url` is required. The other fields are optional. The default method is `GET`.

Some notes about the possible fields:

- `body`: you can use a regular JavaScript object for JSON payload, a buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for `multipart/form-data`, and `URLSearchParams` for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- `headers`: a key-value pair.  
	* If `body` is an instance of `FormData` then n8n adds `content-type: multipart/form-data` automatically.  
	* If `body` is an instance of `URLSearchParams`, then n8n adds `content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.  
	* To override this behavior, set a `content-type` header.
- `arrayFormat`: if your query string contains an array of data, such as `const qs = {IDs: [15,17]}`, the value of `arrayFormat` defines how n8n formats it.  
	* `indices` (default):  `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[0]=b&a[1]=c`  
	* `brackets`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[]=b&a[]=c`  
	* `repeat`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b&a=c`  
	* `comma`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b,c`
- `auth`: Used for Basic auth. Provide `username` and `password`. n8n recommends omitting this, and using `helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication(...)` instead.
- `disableFollowRedirect`: By default, n8n follows redirects. You can set this to true to prevent this from happening.
- `skipSslCertificateValidation`: Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate
- `returnFullResponse`: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: `{body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'}`
- `encoding`: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify `arrayBuffer` to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.

## Example

For an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost/v1/MattermostV1.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Deprecation of the previous helper

The previous helper implementation using `this.helpers.request(options)` used and exposed the `request-promise` library. This was removed in version 1.

To minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called `Axios`.

If you are having issues, please report them in the [Community Forums](https://community.n8n.io/){:target=_blank .external-link} or on [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Migration guide to the new helper

The new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use.

New nodes should all use the new helper. You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating:

- Accepts `url`. Doesn't accept `uri`.
- `encoding: null` now must be `encoding: arrayBuffer`.
- `rejectUnauthorized: false` is now `skipSslCertificateValidation: true`
- Use `body` according to `content-type` headers to clarify the payload.
- `resolveWithFullResponse` is now `returnFullResponse` and has similar behavior"

# Node codex files

The codex file contains metadata about your node. This file is the JSON file at the root of your node. For example, the [`HttpBin.node.json`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/nodes/HttpBin/HttpBin.node.json){:target=_blank .external-class} file in the n8n starter. 

The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex would be named `MyNode.node.json`.

| Parameter | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `node`    | Includes the node name. Must start with `n8n-nodes-base.`. For example, `n8n-nodes-base.openweatherapi`. | 
| `nodeVersion` | The node version. This should have the same value as the `version` parameter in your main node file. For example, `""1.0""`. |
| `codexVersion` | The codex file version. The current version is `""1.0""`. |
| `categories` | The settings in the `categories` array determine which category n8n adds your node to in the GUI. See [Node categories](#node-categories) for more information. |
| `resources` | The `resources` object contains links to your node documentation. n8n automatically adds help links to credentials and nodes in the GUI. |

## Node categories

You can define one or more categories in your node configuration JSON. This helps n8n put the node in the correct category in the nodes panel.

Choose from these categories:

* Data & Storage
* Finance & Accounting
* Marketing & Content
* Productivity
* Miscellaneous
* Sales
* Development
* Analytics
* Communication
* Utility

You must match the syntax. For example, `Data & Storage` not `data and storage`."

# Node file structure

Following best practices and standards in your node structure makes your node easier to maintain. It's helpful if other people need to work with the code.

The file and directory structure of your node depends on:

* Your node's complexity.
* Whether you use node versioning.
* How many nodes you include in the npm package.

## Required files and directories

Your node must include:

* A `package.json` file at the root of the project. This is required for any npm module.
* A `nodes` directory, containing the code for your node:
    * This directory must contain the [base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/), in the format `<node-name>.node.ts`. For example, `MyNode.node.ts`.
    * n8n recommends including a [codex file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/), containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex name is `MyNode.node.json`.
    * The `nodes` directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.
* A `credentials` directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single [credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/). The filename format is `<node-name>.credentials.ts`. For example, `MyNode.credentials.ts`.

## Modular structure
<!-- vale off -->
You can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out.
<!-- vale on -->

A basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the [HttpBin starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/tree/master/nodes/HttpBin){:target=_blank .external-link} for an example of this.

For more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable){:target=_blank .external-class} or [Microsoft Outlook node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Microsoft/Outlook){:target=_blank .external-link} as examples. 

  * `actions`: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources.
    * Each sub-directory should contain two types of files: 
      * An index file with resource description (named either `<resourceName>.resource.ts` or `index.ts`) 
      * Files for operations `<operationName>.operation.ts`. These files should have two exports: `description` of the operation and an `execute` function.
  * `methods`: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions.  
  * `transport`: a directory containing the communication implementation.


## Versioning

If your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning.

## Decide how many nodes to include in a package

There are two possible setups when building a node:

* One node in one npm package.
* More than one node in a single npm package.

n8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the `nodes` directory.

## A best-practice example for programmatic nodes

n8n's built-in [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable){:target=_blank .external-class} implements a modular structure and versioning, following recommended patterns."

# Node versioning

n8n supports node versioning. You can make changes to existing nodes without breaking the existing behavior by introducing a new version.

Be aware of how n8n decides which node version to load:

* If a user builds and saves a workflow using version 1, n8n continues to use version 1 in that workflow, even if you create and publish a version 2 of the node.
* When a user creates a new workflow and browses for nodes, n8n always loads the latest version of the node.

/// note | Versioning type restricted by node style
If you build a node using the declarative style, you can't use full versioning.
///
## Light versioning

This is available for all node types.

One node can contain more than one version, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature: 

1. Change the main `version` parameter to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. 
2. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` in any object (to control which versions n8n displays the object with). You can also query the version from a function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.

As an example, say you want to add versioning to the NasaPics node from the [Declarative node tutorial](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/), then configure a resource so that n8n only displays it in version 2 of the node. In your base `NasaPics.node.ts` file:

```js
{
    displayName: 'NASA Pics',
    name: 'NasaPics',
    icon: 'file:nasapics.svg',
    // List the available versions
    version: [1,2,3],
    // More basic parameters here
    properties: [
        // Add a resource that's only displayed for version2
        {
            displayName: 'Resource name',
            // More resource parameters
            displayOptions: {
                show: {
                    '@version': 2,
                },
            },
        },
    ],
}
```

## Full versioning

This isn't available for declarative-style nodes.

As an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Full versioning summary:

- The base node file should extend `NodeVersionedType` instead of `INodeType`.
- The base node file should contain a description including the `defaultVersion` (usually the latest), other basic node metadata such as name, and a list of versions. It shouldn't contain any node functionality.
- n8n recommends using `v1`, `v2`, and so on, for version folder names."

# Node user interface elements

n8n provides a set of predefined UI components (based on a JSON file) that allows users to input all sorts of data types. The following UI elements are available in n8n.

## String

Basic configuration:

```typescript
{
	displayName: Name, // The value the user sees in the UI
	name: name, // The name used to reference the element UI within the code
	type: string,
	required: true, // Whether the field is required or not
	default: 'n8n',
	description: 'The name of the user',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```


![String](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/string.png)


String field for inputting passwords:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Password',
	name: 'password',
	type: 'string',
	required: true,
	typeOptions: {
		password: true,
	},
	default: '',
	description: `User's password`,
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Password](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/password.png)


String field with more than one row:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Description',
	name: 'description',
	type: 'string',
	required: true,
	typeOptions: {
		rows: 4,
	},
	default: '',
	description: 'Description',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Multiple rows](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/multiple-rows.png)

### Support drag and drop for data keys

Users can drag and drop data values to map them to fields. Dragging and dropping creates an expression to load the data value. n8n supports this automatically.

You need to add an extra configuration option to support dragging and dropping data keys:

* `requiresDataPath: 'single'`: for fields that require a single string.
* `requiresDataPath: 'multiple'`: for fields that can accept a comma-separated list of string.

The [Compare Datasets node code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/CompareDatasets/CompareDatasets.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} has examples.

## Number

Number field with decimal points:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Amount',
	name: 'amount',
	type: 'number',
	required: true,
	typeOptions: {
		maxValue: 10,
		minValue: 0,
		numberPrecision: 2,
	},
	default: 10.00,
	description: 'Your current amount',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Decimal](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/decimal.png)

## Collection

Use the `collection` type when you need to display optional fields.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Filters',
	name: 'filters',
	type: 'collection',
	placeholder: 'Add Field',
	default: {},
	options: [
		{
			displayName: 'Type',
			name: 'type',
			type: 'options',
			options: [
				{
					name: 'Automated',
					value: 'automated',
				},
				{
					name: 'Past',
					value: 'past',
				},
				{
					name: 'Upcoming',
					value: 'upcoming',
				},
			],
			default: '',
		},
	],
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Collection](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/collection.png)


## DateTime

The `dateTime` type provides a date picker.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Modified Since',
	name: 'modified_since',
	type: 'dateTime',
	default: '',
	description: 'The date and time when the file was last modified',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![DateTime](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/datetime.png)



## Boolean

The `boolean` type adds a toggle for entering true or false.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Wait for Image',
	name: 'waitForImage',
	type: 'boolean',
	default: true, // Initial state of the toggle
	description: 'Whether to wait for the image or not',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Boolean](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/boolean.png)

## Color

The `color` type provides a color selector.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Background Color',
	name: 'backgroundColor',
	type: 'color',
	default: '', // Initially selected color
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Color](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/color.png)

## Options

The `options` type adds an options list. Users can select a single value.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Resource',
	name: 'resource',
	type: 'options',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Image',
			value: 'image',
		},
		{
			name: 'Template',
			value: 'template',
		},
	],
	default: 'image', // The initially selected option
	description: 'Resource to consume',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Options](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/options.png)

## Multi-options

The `multiOptions` type adds an options list. Users can select more than one value.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Events',
	name: 'events',
	type: 'multiOptions',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Plan Created',
			value: 'planCreated',
		},
		{
			name: 'Plan Deleted',
			value: 'planDeleted',
		},
	],
	default: [], // Initially selected options
	description: 'The events to be monitored',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}

## Filter

Use this component to evaluate, match, or filter incoming data.

This is the code from n8n's own If node. It shows a filter component working with a [collection](#collection) component where users can configure the filter's behavior.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Conditions',
	name: 'conditions',
	placeholder: 'Add Condition',
	type: 'filter',
	default: {},
	typeOptions: {
		filter: {
			// Use the user options (below) to determine filter behavior
			caseSensitive: '={{!$parameter.options.ignoreCase}}',
			typeValidation: '={{$parameter.options.looseTypeValidation ? ""loose"" : ""strict""}}',
		},
	},
},
{
displayName: 'Options',
name: 'options',
type: 'collection',
placeholder: 'Add option',
default: {},
options: [
	{
		displayName: 'Ignore Case',
		description: 'Whether to ignore letter case when evaluating conditions',
		name: 'ignoreCase',
		type: 'boolean',
		default: true,
	},
	{
		displayName: 'Less Strict Type Validation',
		description: 'Whether to try casting value types based on the selected operator',
		name: 'looseTypeValidation',
		type: 'boolean',
		default: true,
	},
],
},
```

![Filter](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/filter.png)


## Assignment collection (drag and drop)

Use the drag and drop component when you want users to pre-fill name and value parameters with a single drag interaction.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Fields to Set',
	name: 'assignments',
	type: 'assignmentCollection',
	default: {},
},
```

You can see an example in n8n's [Edit Fields (Set) node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/0faeab1228e26d69a2a93bdb2f89523cca1e4036/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Set/v2){:target=_blank .external-link}:

![A gif showing the drag and drop action, as well as changing a field to fixed](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/set/drag-drop-fixed-toggle.gif)

## Fixed collection

Use the `fixedCollection` type to group fields that are semantically related.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Metadata',
	name: 'metadataUi',
	placeholder: 'Add Metadata',
	type: 'fixedCollection',
	default: '',
	typeOptions: {
		multipleValues: true,
	},
	description: '',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'metadataValues',
			displayName: 'Metadata',
			values: [
				{
					displayName: 'Name',
					name: 'name',
					type: 'string',
					default: 'Name of the metadata key to add.',
				},
				{
					displayName: 'Value',
					name: 'value',
					type: 'string',
					default: '',
					description: 'Value to set for the metadata key.',
				},
			],
		},
	],
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

## Resource locator

![Resource locator](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/resource-locator.png)

The resource locator element helps users find a specific resource in an external service, such as a card or label in Trello. 

The following options are available:

* ID
* URL
* List: allows users to select or search from a prepopulated list. This option requires more coding, as you must populate the list, and handle searching if you choose to support it.

You can choose which types to include.

Example:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Card',
	name: 'cardID',
	type: 'resourceLocator',
	default: '',
	description: 'Get a card',
	modes: [
		{
			displayName: 'ID',
			name: 'id',
			type: 'string',
			hint: 'Enter an ID',
			validation: [
				{
					type: 'regex',
					properties: {
						regex: '^[0-9]',
						errorMessage: 'The ID must start with a number',
					},
				},
			],
			placeholder: '12example',
			// How to use the ID in API call
			url: '=http://api-base-url.com/?id={{$value}}',
		},
		{
			displayName: 'URL',
			name: 'url',
			type: 'string',
			hint: 'Enter a URL',
			validation: [
				{
					type: 'regex',
					properties: {
						regex: '^http',
						errorMessage: 'Invalid URL',
					},
				},
			],
			placeholder: 'https://example.com/card/12example/',
			// How to get the ID from the URL
			extractValue: {
				type: 'regex',
				regex: 'example.com/card/([0-9]*.*)/',
			},
		},
		{
			displayName: 'List',
			name: 'list',
			type: 'list',
			typeOptions: {
				// You must always provide a search method
				// Write this method within the methods object in your base file
				// The method must populate the list, and handle searching if searchable: true
				searchListMethod: 'searchMethod',
				// If you want users to be able to search the list
				searchable: true,
				// Set to true if you want to force users to search
				// When true, users can't browse the list
				// Or false if users can browse a list
				searchFilterRequired: true,
			},
		},
	],
	displayOptions: {
		// the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			],
		},
	},
},
```

## Resource mapper

If your node performs insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. A common pattern is to use a Set node before the node that sends data, to convert the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node, rather than using a Set node. The resource mapper component can also validate input data against the schema provided in the node, and cast input data into the expected type.

/// note | Mapping and matching
Mapping is the process of setting the input data to use as values when updating row(s). Matching is the process of using column names to identify the row(s) to update. 
///	

```js
{
	displayName: 'Columns',
	name: 'columns', // The name used to reference the element UI within the code
	type: 'resourceMapper', // The UI element type
	default: {
		// mappingMode can be defined in the component (mappingMode: 'defineBelow')
		// or you can attempt automatic mapping (mappingMode: 'autoMapInputData')
		mappingMode: 'defineBelow',
		// Important: always set default value to null
		value: null,
	},
	required: true,
	// See ""Resource mapper type options interface"" below for the full typeOptions specification
	typeOptions: {
		resourceMapper: {
			resourceMapperMethod: 'getMappingColumns',
			mode: 'update',
			fieldWords: {
				singular: 'column',
				plural: 'columns',
			},
			addAllFields: true, 
			multiKeyMatch: true,
			supportAutoMap: true,
			matchingFieldsLabels: {
				title: 'Custom matching columns title',
				description: 'Help text for custom matching columns',
				hint: 'Below-field hint for custom matching columns',
			},
		},
	},
},
```

Refer to the [Postgres node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2){:target=_blank .external-link} for a live example using a database schema.

Refer to the [Google Sheets node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2){:target=_blank .external-link} for a live example using a schema-less service.

### Resource mapper type options interface

The `typeOptions` section must implement the following interface:

```js
export interface ResourceMapperTypeOptions {
	// The name of the method where you fetch the schema
	// Refer to the Resource mapper method section for more detail
	resourceMapperMethod: string;
	// Choose the mode for your operation
	// Supported modes: add, update, upsert
	mode: 'add' | 'update' | 'upsert';
	// Specify labels for fields in the UI
	fieldWords?: { singular: string; plural: string };
	// Whether n8n should display a UI input for every field when node first added to workflow
	// Default is true
	addAllFields?: boolean;
	// Specify a message to show if no fields are fetched from the service 
	// (the call is successful but the response is empty)
	noFieldsError?: string;
	// Whether to support multi-key column matching
	// multiKeyMatch is for update and upsert only
	// Default is false
	// If true, the node displays a multi-select dropdown for the matching column selector
	multiKeyMatch?: boolean;
	// Whether to support automatic mapping
	// If false, n8n hides the mapping mode selector field and sets mappingMode to defineBelow
	supportAutoMap?: boolean;
	// Custom labels for the matching columns selector
	matchingFieldsLabels?: {
		title?: string;
		description?: string;
		hint?: string;
	};
}
```

### Resource mapper method

This method contains your node-specific logic for fetching the data schema. Every node must implement its own logic for fetching the schema, and setting up each UI field according to the schema.

It must return a value that implements the `ResourceMapperFields` interface:

```js
interface ResourceMapperField {
	// Field ID as in the service
	id: string;
	// Field label
	displayName: string;
	// Whether n8n should pre-select the field as a matching field
	// A matching field is a column used to identify the rows to modify
	defaultMatch: boolean;
	// Whether the field can be used as a matching field
	canBeUsedToMatch?: boolean;
	// Whether the field is required by the schema
	required: boolean;
	// Whether to display the field in the UI
	// If false, can't be used for matching or mapping
	display: boolean;
	// The data type for the field
	// These correspond to UI element types
	// Supported types: string, number, dateTime, boolean, time, array, object, options
	type?: FieldType;
	// Added at runtime if the field is removed from mapping by the user
	removed?: boolean;
	// Specify options for enumerated types
	options?: INodePropertyOptions[];
}
```

Refer to the [Postgres resource mapping method](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2/methods/resourceMapping.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Google Sheets resource mapping method](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2/methods/resourceMapping.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} for live examples.

## JSON

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Content (JSON)',
	name: 'content',
	type: 'json',
	default: '',
	description: '',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![JSON](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/json.png)


## HTML

The HTML editor allows users to create HTML templates in their workflows. The editor supports standard HTML, CSS in `<style>` tags, and expressions wrapped in `{{}}`. Users can add `<script>` tags to pull in additional JavaScript. n8n doesn't run this JavaScript during workflow execution.

```js
{
	displayName: 'HTML Template', // The value the user sees in the UI
	name: 'html', // The name used to reference the element UI within the code
	type: 'string',
	typeOptions: {
		editor: 'htmlEditor',
	},
	default: placeholder, // Loads n8n's placeholder HTML template
	noDataExpression: true, // Prevent using an expression for the field
	description: 'HTML template to render',
},
```

Refer to [`Html.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Html/Html.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} for a live example.


## Notice

Display a yellow box with a hint or extra info. Refer to [Node UI design](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design/) for guidance on writing good hints and info text.

```js
{
  displayName: 'Your text here',
  name: 'notice',
  type: 'notice',
  default: '',
},
```
![Notice](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/notice.png)

## Hints

There are two types of hints: parameter hints and node hints:

* Parameter hints are small lines of text below a user input field.
* Node hints are a more powerful and flexible option than [Notice](#notice). Use them to display longer hints, in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. 

### Add a parameter hint

Add the `hint` parameter to a UI element:

```ts
{
	displayName: 'URL',
	name: 'url',
	type: 'string',
	hint: 'Enter a URL',
	...
}
```

### Add a node hint

Define the node's hints in the `hints` property within the node `description`:

```ts
description: INodeTypeDescription = {
	...
	hints: [
		{
			// The hint message. You can use HTML.
			message: ""This node has many input items. Consider enabling <b>Execute Once</b> in the node\'s settings."",
			// Choose from: info, warning, danger. The default is 'info'.
			// Changes the color. info (grey), warning (yellow), danger (red)
			type: 'info',
			// Choose from: inputPane, outputPane, ndv. By default n8n displays the hint in both the input and output panels.
			location: 'outputPane',
			// Choose from: always, beforeExecution, afterExecution. The default is 'always'
			whenToDisplay: 'beforeExecution',
			// Optional. An expression. If it resolves to true, n8n displays the message. Defaults to true.
			displayCondition: '={{ $parameter[""operation""] === ""select"" && $input.all().length > 1 }}'
		}
	]
	...
}
```

### Add a dynamic hint to a programmatic-style node

In programmatic-style nodes you can create a dynamic message that includes information from the node execution. As it relies on the node output data, you can't display this type of hint until after execution.

```ts
if (operation === 'select' && items.length > 1 && !node.executeOnce) {
    // Expects two parameters: NodeExecutionData and an array of hints
	return new NodeExecutionOutput(
		[returnData],
		[
			{
				message: `This node ran ${items.length} times, once for each input item. To run for the first item only, enable <b>Execute once</b> in the node settings.`,
				location: 'outputPane',
			},
		],
	);
}
return [returnData];
```

For a live example of a dynamic hint in a programmatic-style node, view the [Split Out node code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Transform/SplitOut/SplitOut.node.ts#L266){:target=_blank .external-link}."

# Declarative-style parameters

These are the parameters available for [node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) of declarative-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/).

Refer to [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/) for parameters available to all nodes.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`

_Object_ | _Optional_

`methods` contains the `loadOptions` object. You can use `loadOptions` to query the service to get user-specific settings, then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries. The object must include routing information for how to query the service, and output settings that define how to handle the returned options. For example:

```js
methods : {
	loadOptions: {
		routing: {
			request: {
				url: '/webhook/example-option-parameters',
				method: 'GET',
			},
			output: {
				postReceive: [
					{
						// When the returned data is nested under another property
						// Specify that property key
						type: 'rootProperty',
						properties: {
							property: 'responseData',
						},
					},
					{
						type: 'setKeyValue',
						properties: {
							name: '={{$responseItem.key}} ({{$responseItem.value}})',
							value: '={{$responseItem.value}}',
						},
					},
					{
						// If incoming data is an array of objects, sort alphabetically by key
						type: 'sort',
						properties: {
							key: 'name',
						},
					},
				],
			},
		},
	}
},
```

## `routing`

_Object_ | _Required_

`routing` is an object used within an `options` array in operations and input field objects. It contains the details of an API call.

The code example below comes from the [Declarative-style tutorial](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/). It sets up an integration with a NASA API. It shows how to use `requestDefaults` to set up the basic API call details, and `routing` to add information for each operation.

```js
description: INodeTypeDescription = {
  // Other node info here
  requestDefaults: {
			baseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov',
			url: '',
			headers: {
				Accept: 'application/json',
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			},
		},
    properties: [
      // Resources here
      {
        displayName: 'Operation'
        // Other operation details
        options: [
          {
            name: 'Get'
            value: 'get',
            description: '',
            routing: {
              request: {
                method: 'GET',
                url: '/planetary/apod'
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
}
```

## `version`

_Number_ or _Array_ | _Optional_

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support more than one version, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n supports two methods of node versioning, but declarative-style nodes must use the light versioning approach. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information."

# Node base file

The node base file contains the core code of your node. All nodes must have a base file. The contents of this file are different depending on whether you're building a declarative-style or programmatic-style node. For guidance on which style to use, refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/).

These documents give short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For full walk-throughs of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/) or [Build a programmatic-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node/).

You can also explore the [n8n-nodes-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter){:target=_blank .external-link} and n8n's own [nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes){:target=_blank .external-link} for a wider range of examples. The starter contains basic examples that you can build on. The n8n [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost) is a good example of a more complex programmatic-style node, including versioning.

For all nodes, refer to the:

* [Structure of the node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/structure/)
* [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/)

For declarative-style nodes, refer to the:

* [Declarative-style parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/declarative-style-parameters/)

For programmatic-style nodes, refer to the:

* [Programmatic-style parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-parameters/)
* [Programmatic-style execute() method](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-execute-method/)"

title: Programmatic-style execute() method
description: A reference document for the programmatic-style execute() method of the node base file.
contentType: reference
---

# Programmatic-style execute() method

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles requests using the `routing` key in the `operations` object.

The `execute()` method creates and returns an instance of `INodeExecutionData`.

# Programmatic-style parameters

These are the parameters available for [node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) of programmatic-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a programmatic-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node/).

Programmatic-style nodes also use the `execute()` method. Refer to [Programmatic-style execute method](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-execute-method/) for more information.

Refer to [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/) for parameters available to all nodes.

## `defaultVersion`

_Number_ | _Optional_

Use `defaultVersion` when using the full versioning approach.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`

_Object_ | _Optional_

Contains the `loadOptions` method for programmatic-style nodes. You can use this method to query the service to get user-specific settings (such as getting a user's email labels from Gmail), then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries.

For example, n8n's [Gmail node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Gmail/Gmail.node.ts) uses `loadOptions` to get all email labels:

```js
	methods = {
		loadOptions: {
			// Get all the labels and display them
			async getLabels(
				this: ILoadOptionsFunctions,
			): Promise<INodePropertyOptions[]> {
				const returnData: INodePropertyOptions[] = [];
				const labels = await googleApiRequestAllItems.call(
					this,
					'labels',
					'GET',
					'/gmail/v1/users/me/labels',
				);
				for (const label of labels) {
					const labelName = label.name;
					const labelId = label.id;
					returnData.push({
						name: labelName,
						value: labelId,
					});
				}
				return returnData;
			},
		},
	};
```

## `version`

_Number_ or _Array_ | _Optional_

Use `version` when using the light versioning approach.

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support multiple versions, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Programmatic-style nodes can use either. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information."

contentType: reference
---

# Standard parameters

These are the standard parameters for the [node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/). They're the same for all node types.

## `displayName`

_String_ | _Required_

This is the name users see in the n8n GUI.

## `name`

_String_ | _Required_

The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.

## `icon`

_String_ or _Object_ | _Required_

Specifies an icon for a particular node. n8n recommends uploading your own image file. 

You can provide the icon file name as a string, or as an object to handle different icons for light and dark modes.
If the icon works in both light and dark modes, use a string that starts with `file:`, indicating the path to the icon file. For example:

```
icon: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg'
```
To provide different icons for light and dark modes, use an object with `light` and `dark` properties. For example:
```
icon: { 
  light: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg', 
  dark: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.dark.svg' 
}
```

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/node-icons.md""

## `group`

_Array of strings_ | _Required_

Tells n8n how the node behaves when the workflow runs. Options are:

* `trigger`: node waits for a trigger.
* `schedule`: node waits for a timer to expire.
* `input`, `output`, `transform`: these currently have no effect.
* An empty array, `[]`. Use this as the default option if you don't need `trigger` or `schedule`.

## `description`

_String_ | _Required_

A short description of the node. n8n uses this in the GUI.

## `defaults`

_Object_ | _Required_

Contains essential brand and name settings.

The object can include:

* `name`: String. Used as the node name on the canvas if the `displayName` is too long.
* `color`: String. Hex color code. Provide the brand color of the integration for use in n8n.

## `forceInputNodeExecution`

_Boolean_ | _Optional_

When building a multi-input node, you can choose to force all preceding nodes on all branches to execute before the node runs. The default is `false` (requiring only one input branch to run).

## `inputs`

_Array of strings_ | _Required_

Names the input connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the input side. If you need only one connector, use `input: ['main']`.


## `outputs`

_Array of strings_ | _Required_  

Names the output connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the output side. If you need only one connector, use `output: ['main']`.

## `requiredInputs`

_Integer_ or _Array_ | _Optional_

Used for multi-input nodes. Specify inputs by number that must have data (their branches must run) before the node can execute.

## `credentials`

_Array of objects_ | _Required_  

This parameter tells n8n the credential options. Each object defines an authentication type.

The object must include:

* `name`: the credential name. Must match the `name` property in the credential file. For example, `name: 'asanaApi'`  in [`Asana.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Asana/Asana.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-class} links to `name = 'asanaApi'` in [`AsanaApi.credential.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts){:target=_blank .external-class}.
* `required`: Boolean. Specify whether authentication is required to use this node.

## `requestDefaults`

_Object_ | _Required_  

Set up the basic information for the API calls the node makes.

This object must include:

* `baseURL`: The API base URL.

You can also add:

* `headers`: an object describing the API call headers, such as content type.
* `url`: string. Appended to the `baseURL`. You can usually leave this out. It's more common to provide this in the `operations`.

## `properties`

_Array of objects_ | _Required_  

This contains the resource and operations objects that define node behaviors, as well as objects to set up mandatory and optional fields that can receive user input.

### Resource objects

A resource object includes the following parameters:

* `displayName`: String. This should always be `Resource`.
* `name`: String. This should always be `resource`.
* `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.
* `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `resource`. 

### Operations objects

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

* `displayName`: String. This should always be `Options`.
* `name`: String. This should always be `option`.
* `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `dateTime` results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.
* `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `operation`.
* `options`: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An `options` object includes:
	* `name`. String.
	* `value`. String.
	* `action`: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called `""Card""` and an operation `""Get all""`, your action is `""Get all cards""`.
	* `description`: String.
	* `routing`: Object containing request details.

### Additional fields objects

These objects define optional parameters. n8n displays them under **Additional Fields** in the GUI. Users can choose which parameters to set.

The objects must include:

```js
displayName: 'Additional Fields',
name: 'additionalFields',
// The UI element type
type: ''
placeholder: 'Add Field',
default: {},
displayOptions: {
  // Set which resources and operations this field is available for
  show: {
    resource: [
      // Resource names
    ],
    operation: [
      // Operation names
    ]
  },
}
```

# Structure of the node base file

The node base file follows this basic structure:

1. Add import statements.
2. Create a class for the node.
3. Within the node class, create a `description` object, which defines the node.

A programmatic-style node also has an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `properties` object, within `descriptions`.

## Outline structure for a declarative-style node

This code snippet gives an outline of the node structure. 

```js
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		// Basic node details here
		properties: [
			// Resources and operations here
		]
	};
}
```
Refer to [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/) for information on parameters available to all node types. Refer to [Declarative-style parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/declarative-style-parameters/) for the parameters available for declarative-style nodes.

## Outline structure for a programmatic-style node

This code snippet gives an outline of the node structure. 

```js
import { IExecuteFunctions } from 'n8n-core';
import { INodeExecutionData, INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    // Basic node details here
    properties: [
      // Resources and operations here
    ]
  };

  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
    // Process data and return
  }
};
```

Refer to [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/) for information on parameters available to all node types. Refer to [Programmatic-style parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-parameters/) and [Programmatic-style execute method](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-execute-method/) for more information on working with programmatic-style nodes."

# Deploy a node

This section contains details on how to deploy and share your node.

You can choose to:

* [Submit your node to the community node repository](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/). This makes it available for everyone to use, and allows you to [install and use it](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) like any other community node. This is the only way to use custom nodes on cloud.
* Install the node into your n8n instance as a [private node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/install-private-nodes/)."

# Install private nodes

You can build your own nodes and install them in your n8n instance without publishing them on npm. This is useful for nodes that you create for internal use only at your company.

## Install your node in a Docker n8n instance

If you're running n8n using Docker, you need to create a Docker image with the node installed in n8n. 

1. Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile).

	Your Dockerfile should look like this:

	```Dockerfile
	FROM node:16-alpine

	ARG N8N_VERSION

	RUN if [ -z ""$N8N_VERSION"" ] ; then echo ""The N8N_VERSION argument is missing!"" ; exit 1; fi

	# Update everything and install needed dependencies
	RUN apk add --update graphicsmagick tzdata git tini su-exec

	# Set a custom user to not have n8n run as root
	USER root

	# Install n8n and the packages it needs to build it correctly.
	RUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies python3 build-base ca-certificates && \
		npm config set python ""$(which python3)"" && \
		npm_config_user=root npm install -g full-icu n8n@${N8N_VERSION} && \
		apk del build-dependencies \
		&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root;


	# Install fonts
	RUN apk --no-cache add --virtual fonts msttcorefonts-installer fontconfig && \
		update-ms-fonts && \
		fc-cache -f && \
		apk del fonts && \
		find  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/ -type l -exec unlink {} \; \
		&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root

	ENV NODE_ICU_DATA /usr/local/lib/node_modules/full-icu

	WORKDIR /data

	COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh
	ENTRYPOINT [""tini"", ""--"", ""/docker-entrypoint.sh""]

	EXPOSE 5678/tcp
	```

2. Compile your custom node code (`npm run build` if you are using nodes starter). Copy the **node** and **credential** folders from within the **dist** folder into your container's `~/.n8n/custom/` directory. This makes them available to Docker.

3. Download the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/docker-entrypoint.sh) file, and place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile.

4. Build your Docker image:

	```Dockerfile
	# Replace <n8n-version-number> with the n8n release version number. 
	# For example, N8N_VERSION=0.177.0
	docker build --build-arg N8N_VERSION=<n8n-version-number> --tag=customizedn8n .
	```

You can now use your node in Docker.

## Install your node in a global n8n instance

If you've installed n8n globally, make sure that you install your node inside n8n. n8n will find the module and load it automatically."

# Choose your node building approach

n8n has two node-building styles, declarative and programmatic.

You should use the declarative style for most nodes. This style:

* Uses a JSON-based syntax, making it simpler to write, with less risk of introducing bugs.
* Is more future-proof.
* Supports integration with REST APIs.

The programmatic style is more verbose. You must use the programmatic style for:

* Trigger nodes
* Any node that isn't REST-based. This includes nodes that need to call a GraphQL API and nodes that use external dependencies.
* Any node that needs to transform incoming data.
* Full versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information on types of versioning.

## Data handling differences

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `operations` object. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information on node parameters and the `execute()` method.

## Syntax differences

To understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below. This example creates a simplified version of the SendGrid integration, called ""FriendGrid."" The following code snippets aren't complete: they emphasize the differences in the node building styles.

In programmatic style:

```js
import {
	IExecuteFunctions,
	INodeExecutionData,
	INodeType,
	INodeTypeDescription,
	IRequestOptions,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

// Create the FriendGrid class
export class FriendGrid implements INodeType {
  description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    displayName: 'FriendGrid',
    name: 'friendGrid',
    . . .
    properties: [
      {
        displayName: 'Resource',
        . . .
      },
      {
      displayName: 'Operation',
      name: 'operation',
      type: 'options',
      displayOptions: {
        show: {
            resource: [
            'contact',
            ],
        },
      },
      options: [
        {
          name: 'Create',
          value: 'create',
          description: 'Create a contact',
        },
      ],
      default: 'create',
      description: 'The operation to perform.',
    },
    {
      displayName: 'Email',
      name: 'email',
      . . .
    },
    {
      displayName: 'Additional Fields',
      // Sets up optional fields
    },
  ],
};

  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
    let responseData;
    const resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string;
    const operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string;
    //Get credentials the user provided for this node
    const credentials = await this.getCredentials('friendGridApi') as IDataObject;

    if (resource === 'contact') {
      if (operation === 'create') {
      // Get email input
      const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', 0) as string;
      // Get additional fields input
      const additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', 0) as IDataObject;
      const data: IDataObject = {
          email,
      };

      Object.assign(data, additionalFields);

      // Make HTTP request as defined in https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/
      const options: IRequestOptions = {
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${credentials.apiKey}`,
        },
        method: 'PUT',
        body: {
            contacts: [
            data,
            ],
        },
        url: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`,
        json: true,
      };
      responseData = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);
      }
    }
    // Map data to n8n data
    return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(responseData)];
  }
}
```

In declarative style:

```js
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

// Create the FriendGrid class
export class FriendGrid implements INodeType {
  description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    displayName: 'FriendGrid',
    name: 'friendGrid',

    // Set up the basic request configuration
    requestDefaults: {
        baseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing'
    },
    properties: [
        {
        displayName: 'Resource',
        . . .
        },
        {
        displayName: 'Operation',
        name: 'operation',
        type: 'options',
        displayOptions: {
          show: {
            resource: [
                'contact',
            ],
          },
        },
        options: [
          {
            name: 'Create',
            value: 'create',
            description: 'Create a contact',
            // Add the routing object
            routing: {
                request: {
                method: 'POST',
                url: '=/contacts',
                send: {
                    type: 'body',
                    properties: {
                    email: {{$parameter[""email""]}}
                    }
                }
                }
            },
            // Handle the response to contact creation
            output: {
                postReceive: [
                {
                    type: 'set',
                    properties: {
                    value: '={{ { ""success"": $response } }}'
                    }
                }
                ]
            }
            },
        ],
        default: 'create',
        description: 'The operation to perform.',
        },
        {
        displayName: 'Email',

# Node types: Trigger and Action

There are two node types you can build for n8n: trigger nodes and action nodes.

Both types provide integrations with external services. 

## Trigger nodes

Trigger nodes start a workflow and supply the initial data. A workflow can contain multiple trigger nodes but with each execution, only one of them will execute, depending on the triggering event.

There are three types of trigger nodes in n8n: 

| Type | Description | Example Nodes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Webhook | Nodes for services that support webhooks. These nodes listen for events and trigger workflows in real time. | [Zendesk Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Zendesk){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Telegram Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Telegram){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Brevo Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo){:target=_blank .external-link} |
| Polling | Nodes for services that don't support webhooks. These nodes periodically check for new data, triggering workflows when they detect updates. | [Airtable Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Gmail Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Gmail){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Google Sheet Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet){:target=_blank .external-link}, [RssFeed Read Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/RssFeedRead){:target=_blank .external-link} |
| Others | Nodes that handle real-time responses not related to HTTP requests or polling. This includes message queue nodes and time-based triggers. | [AMQP Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Amqp){:target=_blank .external-link}, [RabbitMQ Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/RabbitMQ){:target=_blank .external-link}, [MQTT Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/MQTT){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Schedule Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Schedule){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Email Trigger (IMAP)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/EmailReadImap){:target=_blank .external-link} |

## Action nodes

Action nodes perform operations as part of your workflow. These can include manipulating data, and triggering events in other systems."

# Design your node's user interface

Most nodes are a GUI (graphical user interface) representation of an API. Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience.

This document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes.

## Design guidance

All node's use n8n's [node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/), so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process:

* Review the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself:
    * What can you leave out? 
    * What can you simplify?
    * Which parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them?
* Use a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on [showing and hiding fields](#showing-and-hiding-fields).

## Standards

### UI text style

| Element | Style |
| ------- | ----- |
| Drop-down value | Title case |
| Hint | Sentence case |
| Info box | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence information. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |
| Node name | Title case |
| Parameter name | Title case |
| Subtitle | Title case |
| Tooltip | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence tooltips. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |

### UI text terminology

* Use the same terminology as the service the node connects to. For example, a Notion node should refer to Notion blocks, not Notion paragraphs, because Notion calls these elements blocks. There are exceptions to this rule, usually to avoid technical terms (for example, refer to the guidance on [name and description for upsert operations](#upsert-operations)).
* Sometimes a service has different terms for something in its API and in its GUI. Use the GUI language in your node, as this is what most users are familiar with. If you think some users may need to refer to the service's API docs, consider including this information in a hint.
* Don't use technical jargon when there are simpler alternatives.
* Be consistent when naming things. For example, choose one of `directory` or `folder` then stick to it. 

### Node naming conventions

| Convention | Correct | Incorrect |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- |
| If a node is a trigger node, <br>the displayed name should have 'Trigger' at the end, <br>with a space before. | Shopify Trigger | ShopifyTrigger, Shopify trigger |
| Don't include 'node' in the name. | Asana | Asana Node, Asana node |

### Showing and hiding fields

Fields can either be:

* Displayed when the node opens: use this for resources and operations, and required fields.
* Hidden in the **Optional fields** section until a user clicks on that section: use this for optional fields.

Progressively disclose complexity: hide a field until any earlier fields it depends on have values. For example, if you have a **Filter by date** toggle, and a **Date to filter by** datepicker, don't display **Date to filter by** until the user enables **Filter by date**.


### Conventions by field type

#### Credentials

n8n automatically displays credential fields as the top fields in the node.

#### Resources and operations

APIs usually involve doing something to data. For example, ""get all tasks."" In this example, ""task"" is the resource, and ""get all"" is the operation.

When your node has this resource and operation pattern, your first field should be **Resource**, and your second field should be **Operation**.

#### Required fields

Order fields by:

* Most important to least important.
* Scope: from broad to narrow. For example, you have fields for **Document**, **Page**, and **Text to insert**, put them in that order.

#### Optional fields

* Order fields alphabetically. To group similar things together, you can rename them. For example, rename **Email** and **Secondary Email** to **Email (primary)** and **Email (secondary)**.
* If an optional field has a default value that the node uses when the value isn't set, load the field with that value. Explain this in the field description. For example, **Defaults to false**.
* Connected fields: if one optional fields is dependent on another, bundle them together. They should both be under a single option that shows both fields when selected.
* If you have a lot of optional fields, consider grouping them by theme.

#### Help

There are five types of help built in to the GUI:

* Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to [UI elements | Notice](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#notice) for more information.
  * Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention.
* Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive.
* Node hints: provide help in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. Refer to [UI elements | Hints](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#hints) for more information.
* Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon ![""Screenshot of the tooltip icon. The icon is a ? in a grey circle""](/_images/common-icons/help-tooltip.png). Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need.
  * You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information. 
  * When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it.
* Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field.

Info boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information.

#### Errors

Make it clear which fields are required.

Add validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email.

When displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in **Details**.

#### Toggles

* Tooltips for binary states should start with something like **Whether to . . . **.
* You may need a list rather than a toggle:
    * Use toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, **Simplify Output?**. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.
    * Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, **Append?**. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).

#### Lists

* Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.
* Sort list options alphabetically.
* You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.
* If there is an option like **All**, use the word **All**, not shorthand like *****.

#### Trigger node inputs

When a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:

* Name the parameter **Trigger on**.
* Don't include a tooltip.

#### Subtitles

Set subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:

```js
subtitle: '={{$parameter[""operation""] + "": "" + $parameter[""resource""]}}',
```

#### IDs

When performing an operation on a specific record, such as ""update a task comment"" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.

* Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:
    * By choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the `loadOptions` parameter. Refer to [Base files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information.
    * By entering an ID.
* Name the field `<Record name> name or ID`. For example, **Workspace Name or ID**. Add a tooltip saying ""Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression."" Link to n8n's [Expressions](/code/expressions/) documentation.
* Build your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example:
    * If you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path.
    * If the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL.

#### Dates and timestamps

n8n uses [ISO timestamp strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601){:target=_blank class=.external-link} for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.

#### JSON

You should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:

* Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.
* Using an expression that returns JSON.



#### Node icons

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/node-icons.md""


### Common patterns and exceptions

This section provides guidance on handling common design patterns, including some edge cases and exceptions to the main standards.

#### Simplify responses

APIs can return a lot of data that isn't useful. Consider adding a toggle that allows users to choose to simplify the response data:

  * Name: **Simplify Response**
  * Description: **Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data**

#### Upsert operations

This should always be a separate operation with:

  * Name: **Create or Update**
  * Description: **Create a new record, or update the current one if it already exists (upsert)**

#### Boolean operators
<!-- vale off -->
n8n doesn't have good support for combining boolean operators, such as AND and OR, in the GUI. Whenever possible, provide options for all ANDs or all ORs.
<!-- vale on -->

For example, you have a field called **Must match** to test if values match. Include options to test for **Any** and **All**, as separate options.

#### Source keys or binary properties

Binary data is file data, such as spreadsheets or images. In n8n, you need a named key to reference the data. Don't use the terms ""binary data"" or ""binary property"" for this field. Instead, use a more descriptive name: **Input data field name** / **Output data field name**."

# Test a node

This section contains information about testing your node.

There are two ways to test your node:

* Manually, by [running it on your own machine](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/run-node-locally/) within a local n8n instance.
* Automatically, using the [linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter/).

You should use both methods before publishing your node."

# n8n node linter

n8n's node linter, [`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base), statically analyzes (""lints"") the source code of n8n nodes and credentials in the official repository and in community packages. The linter detects issues and automatically fixes them to help you follow best practices.

`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base` contains a [collection of rules](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset) for node files (`*.node.ts`), resource description files (`*Description.ts`), credential files (`*.credentials.ts`), and the `package.json` of a community package.

## Setup

If using the [n8n node starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter): Run `npm install` in the starter project to install all dependencies. Once the installation finishes, the linter is available to you. 

If using VS Code, install the [ESLint VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.VS Code-eslint). For other IDEs, refer to their ESLint integrations.

/// note | Don't edit the configuration file
[`.eslintrc.js`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) contains the configuration for `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`. Don't edit this file.
///

## Usage

You can use the linter in a community package or in the main n8n repository.

### Linting

In a community package, the linter runs automatically after installing dependencies and before publishing the package to npm. In the [main n8n repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n){:target=_blank .external-link}, the linter runs automatically using GitHub Actions whenever you push to your pull request.

In both cases, VS Code lints in the background as you work on your project. Hover over a detected issue to see a full description of the linting and a link to further information.

You can also run the linter manually:

* Run `npm run lint` to lint and view detected issues in your console. 
* Run `npm run lintfix` to lint and automatically fix issues. The linter fixes violations of rules [marked as automatically fixable](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset).

Both commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in `/packages/nodes-base/` in the main repository.

### Exceptions

Instead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it.

To make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on `Quick fix` (or `cmd+.` in macOS) and select **Disable {rule} for this line**. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please [report it in the linter repository](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base/issues).

To add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the [TSLint documentation](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/) for more guidance."

# Troubleshooting

## Credentials

<!-- vale off -->
### Error message: 'Credentials of type ""*"" aren't known'
<!-- vale on -->

Check that the name in the credentials array matches the name used in the property name of the credentials' class.

![Troubleshooting credentials](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/troubleshooting-credentials-1.png)

<!-- vale off -->
## Editor UI
<!-- vale on -->

<!-- vale off -->
### Error message: 'There was a problem loading init data: API-Server can not be reached. It's probably down'
<!-- vale on -->

- Check that the names of the node file, node folder, and class match the path added to `packages/nodes-base/package.json`.
- Check that the names used in the `displayOptions` property are names used by UI elements in the node.

<!-- vale off -->
### Node icon doesn't show up in the Add Node menu and the Editor UI
<!-- vale on -->

- Check that the icon is in the same folder as the node.
- Check that it's either in PNG or SVG format.
- When the `icon` property references the icon file, check that it includes the logo extension (`.png` or `.svg`) and that it prefixes it with `file:`. For example, `file:friendGrid.png` or `file:friendGrid.svg`.

### Node icon doesn't fit

- If you use an SVG file, make sure the canvas size is square. You can find instructions to change the canvas size of an SVG file using GIMP [here](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-image-resize.html).
- If you use a PNG file, make sure that it's 60x60 pixels.

### Node doesn't show up in the Add Node menu

Check that you registered the node in the `package.json` file in your project.

<!-- vale off -->
### Changes to the description properties don't show in the UI on refreshing
<!-- vale on -->

Every time you change the description properties, you have to stop the current n8n process (`ctrl` + `c`) and run it again. You may also need to re-run `npm link`.

### Linter incorrectly warning about file name case

The node linter has rules for file names, including what case they should be. Windows users may encounter an issue when renaming files that causes the linter to continue giving warnings, even after you rename the files. This is due to a [known Windows issue](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/file-renaming-when-changing-case-doesnt-work/aa15ff7c-dd2d-4ed3-bcce-799ca90d4e58) with changing case when renaming files."

## Change instance ownership

You can change the ownership of an instance by navigating to the **Settings** page in the owner's account and editing the **Email** field. After making the changes, scroll down and press **Save**.
Note that for the change to be effective, the new email address can't be linked to any other n8n account.

Changing emails will change the owner of the instance, the email you log in with, and the email your invoices and general communication gets sent to.

## Change instance username

It's not currently possible to change usernames.
If you want your instance to have a different name you will need to create a new account and transfer your work into it. [Here](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/export-import/) you can see how you can transfer your work no a new n8n instance."

# Cloud data management

There are two concerns when managing data on Cloud:

* Memory usage: complex workflows processing large amounts of data can exceed n8n's memory limits. If this happens, the instance can crash and become inaccessible.
* Data storage: depending on your execution settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage. 

To avoid these issues, n8n recommends that you build your workflows with memory efficiency in mind, and don't save unnecessary data

## Memory limits on each Cloud plan

Current plans:

* Trial: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
* Starter: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
* Pro-1 (10k executions): 640MiB RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
* Pro-2 (50k executions): 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable
* Enterprise: 4096MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

Legacy plans:

* Start: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
* Power: 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

n8n gives each instance up to 100GB of data storage.

## How to reduce memory consumption in your workflow

The way you build workflows affects how much data they consume when executed. Although these guidelines aren't applicable to all cases, they provide a baseline of best practices to avoid exceeding instance memory.

--8<-- ""_snippets/self-hosting/scaling/reduce-memory-consumption.md""

Note that n8n itself consumes memory to run. On average, the software alone uses around 180MiB RAM.

Interactions with the UI also consume memory. Playing around with the workflow UI while it performs heavy executions could also push the memory capacity over the limit.

## How to manage execution data on Cloud

Execution data includes node data, parameters, variables, execution context, and binary data references. It's text-based.

Binary data is non-textual data that n8n can't represent as plain text. This is files and media such as images, documents, audio files, and videos. It's much larger than textual data.

If a workflow consumes a large amounts of data and is past testing stage, it's a good option to stop saving the successful executions.

There are two ways you can control how much execution data n8n stores in the database:

In the admin dashboard:

1. From your workspace or editor, navigate to **Admin Panel**.
1. Select **Manage**.
1. In **Executions to Save** deselect the executions you don't want to log.

In your workflow settings:

1. Select the **Options** <span class=""inline-image"">![Options menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> menu.
1. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
1. Change **Save successful production executions** to **Do not save**.

## Cloud data pruning and out of memory incident prevention

### Automatic data pruning

n8n automatically prunes execution logs after a certain time or once you reach the max storage limit, whichever comes first. The pruning always happens from oldest to newest and the limits depend on your Could plan:

* Start and Starter plans: max 2500 executions saved and 7 days execution log retention;
* Pro and Power plans: max 25000 executions saved and 30 days execution log retention;
* Enterprise plan: max 50000 executions saved and unlimited execution log retention time.

### Manual data pruning

Heavier executions and use cases can exceed database capacity despite the automatic pruning practices. In cases like this, n8n will manually prune data to protect instance stability.

1. An alert system warns n8n if an instance is at 85% disk capacity.
2. n8n prunes execution data. n8n does this by running a backup of the instance (workflows, users, credentials and execution data) and restoring it without execution data.
 	

Due to the human steps in this process, the alert system isn't perfect. If warnings are triggered after hours or if data consumption rates are high, there might not be time to prune the data before the remaining disk space fills up."

# Cloud concurrency

/// info | Only for n8n Cloud
This document discusses concurrency in n8n Cloud. Read [self-hosted n8n concurrency control](/hosting/scaling/concurrency-control/) to learn how concurrency works with self-hosted n8n instances.
///

Too many concurrent executions can cause performance degradation and unresponsiveness. To prevent this and improve instance stability, n8n sets concurrency limits for production executions in regular mode.

Any executions beyond the limits queue for later processing. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order.

## Concurrency limits

n8n limits the number of concurrent executions for Cloud instances according to their plan:

* Starter and Trial: 5
* Pro (10k workflow executions, 15 active workflows): 20
* Pro (50k workflow executions, 50 active workflows): 50
* Enterprise (in regular mode): 200

You can view the number of active executions and your plan's concurrency limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab.

## Details

Some other details about concurrency to keep in mind:

- Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, or error executions.
- You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.
- On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.

## Comparison to queue mode

/// info | Feature availability
Queue mode is available for Cloud Enterprise plans. To enable it, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa){:target=_blank .external-link}.
///

Concurrency in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency in regular mode. In queue mode, the concurrency settings determine how many jobs each worker can run in parallel. In regular mode, concurrency limits apply to the entire instance."

# Privacy

This page describes n8n's data privacy practices.

## GDPR

### Data processing agreement

For Cloud versions of n8n, n8n is considered both a Controller and a Processor as defined by the GDPR. As a Processor, n8n implements policies and practices that secure the personal data you send to the platform, and includes a [Data Processing Agreement](https://n8n.io/legal/#data){:target=_blank .external-link} as part of the company's standard [Terms of Service](https://n8n.io/legal/#terms){:target=_blank .external-link}.

The n8n Data Processing Agreement includes the [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en){:target=_blank .external-link}. These clarify how n8n handles your data, and they update n8n's GDPR policies to cover the latest standards set by the European Commission.

You can find a list of n8n sub-processors [here](https://n8n.io/legal/#subprocessors){:target=_blank .external-link}.

/// note | Self-hosted n8n
For self-hosted versions, n8n is neither a Controller nor a Processor, as we don't manage your data
///
### Submitting a GDPR deletion request

Email privacy@n8n.io to request data deletion.

### Sub-processors

This is a list of sub-processors authorized to process customer data for n8n's service. n8n audits each sub-processor's security controls and applicable regulations for the protection of personal data.

| Sub-processor name | Contact details | Geographic location of processing |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Microsoft Azure | Microsoft Azure <br /> 1 Microsoft Way <br /> Redmond <br /> WA 98052 <br /> USA <br /> Contact information: https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-GB/privacystatement#mainhowtocontactusmodule | Germany (West Central Region) |
| Hetzner Online | Hetzner Online GmbH <br /> Industriestr. 25 <br /> 91710 Gunzenhausen <br /> Germany <br /> data-protection@hetzner.com | Germany |

Subscribe [here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/FdeRxSkH?typeform-source=n8n.io){:target=_blank .external-link} to receive updates when n8n adds or changes a sub-processor.

### GDPR for self-hosted users

--8<-- ""_snippets/privacy-security/gdpr-self-hosted.md""



## Data collection 

n8n collects selected usage and performance data to help diagnose problems and improve the platform. Read about how n8n stores and processes this information in the [privacy policy](https://n8n.io/legal/#privacy){:target=_blank .external-link}.

The data gathered is different in self-hosted n8n and n8n Cloud.

### Data collection in self-hosted n8n

n8n takes care to keep self-hosted data anonymous and avoids collecting sensitive data. 

#### What n8n collects

- Error codes and messages of failed executions (excluding any payload data, and not for custom nodes)
- Error reports for app crashes and API issues
- The graph of a workflow (types of nodes used and how they're connected)
- From node parameters:
    - The 'resource' and 'operation' that a node is set to (if applicable)
    - For HTTP request nodes, the domain, path, and method (with personal data anonymized)
- Data around workflow executions:  
    - Status
    - The user ID of the user who ran the execution
    - The first time a workflow loads data from an external source
    - The first successful production (non-manual) workflow execution
- The domain of webhook calls, if specified (excluding subdomain).
- Details on how the UI is used (for example, navigation, nodes panel searches)
- Diagnostic information:
    - n8n version
    - Selected settings:
        - DB_TYPE
        - N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED
        - N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS
        - [Execution variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/executions)
    - OS, RAM, and CPUs
    - Anonymous instance ID
 - IP address

#### What n8n doesn't collect

n8n doesn't collect private or sensitive information, such as:

- Personally identifiable information (except IP address)
- Credential information
- Node parameters (except 'resource' and 'operation')
- Execution data
- Sensitive settings (for example, endpoints, ports, DB connections, username/password)
- Error payloads

#### How collection works

Most data is sent to n8n as events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours).

#### Opting out of telemetry

Telemetry collection is enabled by default. To disable it you can configure the following environment variables.

To opt out of telemetry events:

```bash
export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false
```

To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n:

```bash
export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
```

See [configuration](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more info on how to set environment variables.

### Data collection in n8n Cloud

n8n Cloud collects everything listed in [Data collection in self-hosted n8n](#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n).

Additionally, in n8n Cloud, n8n uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} to track events and visualise usage, including using session recordings. Session recordings comprise the data seen by a user on screen, with the exception of credential values. n8n's product team uses this data to improve the product. All recordings are deleted after 21 days.

### AI in n8n

To provide enhanced assistance, n8n integrates AI-powered features that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs).

#### How n8n uses AI

To assist and improve user experience, n8n may send specific context data to LLMs. This context data is strictly limited to information about the current workflow. n8n does not send any values from credential fields or actual output data to AI services. The data will not be incorporated, used, or retained to train the models of the AI services. Any data will be deleted after 30 days.

#### When n8n shares data

Data is only sent to AI services if workspaces have opted in to use the assistant. The Assistant is enabled by default for n8n Cloud users. When a workspace opts in to use the assistant, node-specific data is transmitted only during direct interactions and active sessions with the AI assistant, ensuring no unnecessary data sharing occurs.

#### What n8n shares

- **General Workflow Information**: This includes details about which nodes are present in your workflow, the number of items currently in the workflow, and whether the workflow is active.
- **Input & Output Schemas of Nodes**: This includes the schema of all nodes with incoming data and the output schema of a node in question. We do not send the actual data value of the schema.
- **Node Configuration**: This includes the operations, options, and settings chosen in the referenced node.
- **Code and Expressions**: This includes any code or expressions in the node in question to help with debugging potential issues and optimizations.

#### What n8n doesn't share

- **Credentials**: Any values of the credential fields of your nodes.
- **Output Data**: The actual data processed by your workflows.
- **Sensitive Information**: Any personally identifiable information or other sensitive data that could compromise your privacy or security that you have not explicitly mentioned in node parameters or your code of a [Code Node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

### Documentation telemetry

n8n's documentation (this website) uses cookies to recognize your repeated visits and preferences, as well as to measure the effectiveness of n8n's documentation and whether users find what they're searching for. With your consent, you're helping n8n to make our documentation better.

[Change cookie settings](#__consent){ .md-button }

## Retention and deletion of personal identifiable data

PID (personal identifiable data) is data that's personal to you and would identify you as an individual.

### n8n Cloud

#### PID retention

n8n only retains data for as long as necessary to provide the core service. 

For n8n Cloud, n8n stores your workflow code, credentials, and other data indefinitely, until you choose to delete it or close your account. The platform stores execution data according to the retention rules on your account.

n8n deletes most internal application logs and logs tied to subprocessors within 90 days. The company retains a subset of logs for longer periods where required for security investigations.

#### PID deletion

If you choose to delete your n8n account, n8n deletes all customer data and event data associated with your account. n8n deletes customer data in backups within 90 days.

### Self-hosted

Self-hosted users should have their own PID policy and data deletion processes. Refer to [What you can do](/privacy-security/what-you-can-do/) for more information.

## Payment processor

n8n uses Paddle.com to process payments. When you sign up for a paid plan, Paddle transmits and stores the details of your payment method according to their security policy. n8n stores no information about your payment method.

# What you can do

It's also your responsibility as a customer to ensure you are securing your code and data. This document lists some steps you can take.

## All users

* Report security issues and [terms of service](https://n8n.io/legal/#terms){:target=_blank .external-link} violations to security@n8n.io.
* If more than one person uses your n8n instance, set up [User management](/user-management/) and follow the [Best practices](/user-management/best-practices/).
* Use OAuth to connect integrations whenever possible.

## Self-hosted users

If you self-host n8n, there are additional steps you can take:

* Set up a reverse proxy to handle TLS, ensuring data is encrypted in transit.
* Ensure data is encrypted at rest by using encrypted partitions, or encryption at the hardware level, and ensuring n8n and its database is written to that location.
* Run a [Security audit](/hosting/logging-monitoring/security-audit/).
* Be aware of the [Risks](/integrations/community-nodes/risks/) when installing community nodes, or choose to disable them.
* Make sure users can't import external modules in the Code node. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes) for more information.
* Choose to exclude certain nodes. For example, you can disable nodes like Execute Command or SSH. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes) for more information.
* For maximum privacy, you can [Isolate n8n](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/isolation/).

### New features

Notable new features.

#### Resource mapper UI component

This release includes a new UI component, the resource mapper. This component is useful for node creators. If your node does insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. Often it's necessary to use a Set node before a node that sends data, to get the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node.

Refer to [Node user interface elements | Resource mapper](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#resource-mapper) for guidance for node builders.

**Release date:** 2022-07-20

This release includes several major new features, including:

* The community nodes repository: a new way to build and share nodes.
* Data pinning and data mapping: accelerate workflow development with better data manipulation functionality.

### New features

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

#### Community nodes repository

This release introduces the [community node repository](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/). This allows developers to build and share nodes as npm packages. Users can install community-built nodes directly in n8n.

</div>

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

#### Data pinning

[Data pinning](/data/data-pinning/) allows you to freeze and edit data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. This avoids repeated API calls when developing a workflow, reducing calls to external systems, and speeding up workflow development.

</div>

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

#### Data mapping

This release introduces a drag and drop interface for [data mapping](/data/data-mapping/), as a quick way to map data without using expressions.

</div>

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

#### Simplify authentication setup for node creators

This release introduces a simpler way of handling authorization when building a node. All credentials should now contain an `authenticate` property that dictates how the credential is used in a request.
n8n has also simplified authentication types: instead of specifying an authentication type and using the correct interface, you can now set the type as `""generic""`, and use the `IAuthenticateGeneric` interface.

You can use this approach for any authentication method where data is sent in the header, body, or query string. This includes methods like bearer and basic auth. You can't use this approach for more complex authentication types that require multiple calls, or for methods that don't pass authentication data. This includes OAuth.

For an example of the new authentication syntax, refer to n8n's [Asana node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts){:target=_blank .external-link}.

```js
// in AsanaApi.credentials.ts
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.177.0...n8n@0.178.0){:target=_blank .external-link} for this version.<br />
**Release date:** 2022-05-24

This release adds support for reusing existing credentials in the HTTP Request node, making it easier to do custom operation with APIs where n8n already has an integration.

The release also includes improvements to the nodes view, giving better detail about incoming data, as well as some bug fixes.

### New features

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

#### Credential reuse for custom API operations

n8n supplies hundreds of nodes, allowing you to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.

One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. To simplify this, n8n now provides a way to use existential credential types (credentials associated with n8n nodes) in the HTTP Request node.

For more information, refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations/){:target=_blank}.

#### Node details view

An improved node view, showing more detail about node inputs.

</div>

### Node enhancements

[Salesforce Node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforce){:target=_blank}: Add the **Country** field.

### Bug fixes

* **Editor UI**: don't display the dividing line unless necessary.
* **Editor UI**: don't display the 'Welcome' sticky in template workflows.
* [Slack Node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack){:target=_blank}: Fix the kick operation for the channel resource.

**Release date:** 2022-05-02

This release adds support for node versioning, along with node enhancements and bug fixes.



### New features

<div class=""n8n-new-features"" markdown>

#### Node versioning

0.175.0 adds support for a lightweight method of node versioning. One node can contain multiple versions, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature, change the `version` parameter in your node to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` (to control which version n8n displays). You can also query the version in your `execute` function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.

</div>

### Node enhancements

* [Google Sheets node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/): n8n now handles header names formatted as JSON paths.

* **core**: n8n now skips credentials checks for disabled nodes.
* **editor**: fix a bug affecting touchscreen monitors.
* [HubSpot node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspot/): fix for search operators.

## n8n@0.167.0

For a comprehensive list of changes, view the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n%400.166.0...n8n@0.167.0) for this version.<br />
**Release date:** 2022-03-13

### Highlights

#### Luxon and JMESPath

0.167.0 adds support for two new libraries:

* [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/): a JavaScript library for working with date and time
* [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/): a query language for JSON

You can use Luxon and JMESPath in the code editor and in expressions.

#### New expressions variables

We've added two new variables to simplify working with date and time in expressions:

* `$now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to DateTime.now().
* `$today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).

#### Negative operations in If and Switch nodes

Made it easier to perform negative operations on strings.

This release adds one new operation for numbers:

* Is Not Empty

And the following new operations for strings:

* Not Ends With
* Regex Not Match
* Not Starts With
* Is Not Empty

Additionally, Regex is now labelled Regex Match.

#### New node: Redis Trigger

Added a Redis Trigger node, so you can now start workflows based on a Redis event.

* [Redis Trigger:](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redistrigger/) Added a Redis Trigger node.

### Core functionality

- Added support for [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) and [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/).
- Added two new expressions variables, `$now` and `$today`.
- Added more negative operations for numbers and strings.

# Tutorial: Create environments with source control

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/feature-availability.md""

This tutorial walks through the process of setting up environments end-to-end. You'll create two environments: development and production. It uses GitHub as the Git provider. The process is similar for other providers. 

n8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. You link an n8n instance to a Git branch, and use a push-pull pattern to move work between environments. You should have some understanding of environments and Git. If you need more information on these topics, refer to:

* [Environments in n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/environments/): the purpose of environments, and how they work in n8n. 
* [Git and n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/git/): Git concepts and source control in n8n.

## Choose your source control pattern

Before setting up source control and environments, you need to plan your environments, and how they relate to Git branches. n8n supports different [Branch patterns](/source-control-environments/understand/patterns/). For environments, you need to choose between two patterns: multi-instance, multi-branch, or multi-instance, single-branch. This tutorial covers both patterns.

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/one-direction.md""

### Multiple instances, multiple branches

![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/multi-instance-multi-branch-pros-cons.md""


### Multiple instances, one branch

![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/multi-instance-one-branch-pros-cons.md""

## Set up your repository

Once you've chosen your pattern, you need to set up your GitHub repository.

=== ""Multi-branch""

    1. [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository){:target=_blank .external-link}. 
	    * Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.
	    * Create the new repository with a README so you can immediately create branches. 
    1. Create one branch named `production` and another named `development`. Refer to [Creating and deleting branches within your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository){:target=_blank .external-link} for guidance.
			

=== ""Single-branch""

    [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository){:target=_blank .external-link}. 

      * Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.  
      * Create the new repository with a README. This creates the `main` branch, which you'll connect to. 		
		

## Connect your n8n instances to your repository

Create two n8n instances, one for development, one for production. 

### Configure Git in n8n

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/configure-git-in-n8n.md""

### Set up a deploy key

Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access. Refer to [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys){:target=_blank .external-link} for guidance.

### Connect n8n and configure your instance

=== ""Multi-branch""

    1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.
    1. Under **Instance settings**, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance. Connect the production branch to the production instance, and the development branch to the development instance.
    1. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.
    1. Select **Save settings**.

=== ""Single-branch""

    1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. 
	  1. Under **Instance settings**, select the main branch.
    1. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.
    1. Select **Save settings**.

## Push work from development

In your development instance, create a few workflows, tags, variables, and credentials.

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/push.md""

## Pull work to production

Your work is now in GitHub. If you're using a multi-branch setup, it's on the development branch. If you chose the single-branch setup, it's on main.

=== ""Multi-branch""

    1. In GitHub, create a pull request to merge development into production.
    1. Merge the pull request.
    1. In your production instance, select **Pull** <span class=""inline-image"">![Pull icon](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png){.off-glb}</span> in the main menu.

=== ""Single-branch""

    In your production instance, select **Pull** <span class=""inline-image"">![Pull icon](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png){.off-glb}</span> in the main menu.

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/push-pull-menu-state.md""

### Optional: Use a GitHub Action to automate pulls

If you want to avoid logging in to your production instance to pull, you can use a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions){:target=_blank .external-link} and the [n8n API](/api/) to automatically pull every time you push new work to your production or main branch.

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/github-action.md""

# Set up source control for environments

Link a Git repository to an n8n instance and configure your source control.

n8n uses source control to provide environments. Refer to [Environments in n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/environments/) for more information.

## Prerequisites

To use source control with n8n, you need a Git repository that allows SSH access. 

This document assumes you are familiar with Git and your Git provider.

## Step 1: Set up your repository and branches

For a new setup:

1. Create a new repository for use with n8n. 
1. Create the branches you need. For example, if you plan to have different environments for test and production, set up a branch for each.

To help decide what branches you need for your use case, refer to [Branch patterns](/source-control-environments/understand/patterns/).

## Step 2: Configure Git in n8n

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/configure-git-in-n8n.md""

## Step 3: Set up a deploy key

Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access. 

The steps depend on your Git provider. Help links for common providers:

* [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys){:target=_blank .external-link}
* [GitLab | Deploy keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_keys/){:target=_blank .external-link}

## Step 4: Connect n8n and configure your instance

1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.
1. Under **Instance settings**, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance.
1. **Optional**: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance. This is useful for protecting production instances.
1. **Optional**: choose a custom color for the instance. This will appear in the menu next to the source control push and pull buttons. It helps users know which instance they're in.
1. Select **Save settings**."

# Environments in n8n

n8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. This document helps you understand:

* The purpose of environments.
* How environments work in n8n.

## Environments: What and why

In software development, the environment is all the infrastructure and tooling around the code, including the tools that run the software, and the specific configuration of those tools. For a more detailed introduction to environments in software development, refer to [Codecademy | Environments](https://www.codecademy.com/article/environments){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Low-code development in n8n is similar. n8n is where you build and run your workflows. Your instance may have particular configurations: on Cloud, n8n determines the configuration. On self-hosted instances, there are extensive [configuration options](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/). You may also have made changes to the settings of your instance. This combination of n8n and your instance's specific configuration and settings is the environment your workflows run in.

There are advantages to having more than one environment. A common pattern is to have different environments for development and production:

* Development: do work and make changes.
* Production: the live environment.

A setup like this helps you make changes to workflows without breaking workflows that are in use.

## Environments in n8n

In n8n, an environment comprises two parts, an n8n instance and a Git branch:

* The n8n instance is where you build and run workflows.
* The Git branch stores copies of the workflows, as well as tags, and variable and credential stubs.

n8n doesn't sync credentials and variable values with Git. You must set up the credentials and variable values manually when setting up a new instance. For more information, refer to [Push and pull | What gets committed](/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/#what-gets-committed) and [Manage variables](/source-control-environments/using/manage-variables/).

How you copy work between environments depends on your branch and n8n instance configuration:

* Multiple instances, one branch: you can push from one instance to the Git branch, then pull the work to another instance.
* Multiple instances, multiple branches: you need to create a pull request and merge in your Git provider. For example, if you have development, test, and production branches, each linked to their own instance, you need to merge the development branch into test to make the work from the development instance available on the test instance. Refer to [Copy work between environments](/source-control-environments/using/copy-work/) for more information, including steps to partially automate the process.

For detailed guidance on pushing and pulling work, refer to [Push and pull](/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/).

Refer to [Set up source control](/source-control-environments/setup/) to learn more about linking your n8n instance to Git, or follow the [Tutorial: Create environments with source control](/source-control-environments/create-environments/) to set up your environments using one of n8n's recommended configurations."

# Git and n8n

n8n uses Git to provide source control. To use this feature, it helps to have some knowledge of basic Git concepts. n8n doesn't implement all Git functionality: you shouldn't view n8n's source control as full version control.


/// note | New to Git and source control?
If you're new to Git, don't panic. You don't need to learn Git to use n8n. This document explains the concepts you need. You do need some Git knowledge to set up the source control, as this involves work in your Git provider.
///
/// note | Familiar with Git and source control?
If you're familiar with Git, don't rely on behaviors matching exactly. In particular, be aware that source control in n8n doesn't support a pull request-style review and merge process, unless you do this outside n8n in your Git provider.
///

This page introduces the Git concepts and terminology used in n8n. It doesn't cover everything you need to set up and manage a repository. The person doing the [Setup](/source-control-environments/setup/) should have some familiarity with Git and with their Git hosting provider.

/// note | This is a brief introduction
Git is a complex topic. This section provides a brief introduction to the key terms you need when using environments in n8n. If you want to learn about Git in depth, refer to [GitHub | Git and GitHub learning resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources){:target=_blank .external-link}.
///
## Git overview

[Git](https://git-scm.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a tool for managing, tracking, and collaborating on multiple versions of documents. It's the basis for widely used platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Branches: Multiple copies of a project

Git uses branches to maintain multiple copies of a document alongside each other. Every branch has its own version. A common pattern is to have a main branch, and then everyone who wants to contribute to the project works on their own branch (copy). When they finish their work, their branch is merged back into the main branch.

![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/simple-git-branch.png)

## Local and remote: Moving work between your machine and a Git provider

A common pattern when using Git is to install Git on your own computer, and use a Git provider such as GitHub to work with Git in the cloud. In effect, you have a Git repository (project) on GitHub, and work with copies of it on your local machine.

n8n uses this pattern for source control: you'll work with your workflows on your n8n instance, but send them to your Git provider to store them.

## Push, pull, and commit

n8n uses three key Git processes:

* **Push**: send work from your instance to Git. This saves a copy of your workflows and tags, as well as credential and variable stubs, to Git. You can choose which workflows you want to save.
* **Pull**: get the workflows, tags, and variables from Git and load it into n8n. 

    /// warning | Pulling overwrites your work
    If you have made changes to a workflow in n8n, you must push the changes to Git before pulling. When you pull, it overwrites any changes you've made if they aren't stored in Git.
    ///
		
* **Commit**: a commit in n8n is a single occurrence of pushing work to Git. In n8n, commit and push happen at the same time.

Refer to [Push and pull](/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/) for detailed information about how n8n interacts with Git."

contentType: explanation

# Branch patterns

The relationship between n8n instances and Git branches is flexible. You can create different setups depending on your needs. 

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/one-direction.md""

## Multiple instances, multiple branches

This pattern involves having multiple n8n instances, each one linked to its own branch. 

You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them to their own branches. Push work from your development instance to its branch, do a pull request to move work to the production branch, then pull to the production instance.

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/multi-instance-multi-branch-pros-cons.md""

![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)

## Multiple instances, one branch

Use this pattern if you want the same workflows, tags, and variables everywhere, but want to use them in different n8n instances. 

You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them both to the same branch. Push work from development, and pull it into production.

This pattern is also useful when testing a new version of n8n: you can create a new n8n instance with the new version, connect it to the Git branch and test it, while your production instance remains on the older version until you're confident it's safe to upgrade.

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/multi-instance-one-branch-pros-cons.md""

![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)

## One instance, multiple branches

The instance owner can change which Git branch connects to the instance. The full setup in this case is likely to be a [Multiple instances, multiple branches](#multiple-instances-multiple-branches) pattern, but with one instance switching between branches.

This is useful to review work. For example, different users could work on their own instance and push to their own branch. The reviewer could work in a review instance, and switch between branches to load work from different users.

/// note | No cleanup
n8n doesn't clean up the existing contents of an instance when changing branches. Switching branches in this pattern results in all the workflows from each branch being in your instance.
///
![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-one-multi.png)

## One instance, one branch

This is the simplest pattern.

contentType: howto

# Copy work between environments

The steps to send work from one n8n instance to another are different depending on whether you use a single Git branch or multiple branches.

## Single branch

If you have a single Git branch the steps to copy work are:

1. Push work from one instance to the Git branch.
1. Log in to the other instance to pull the work from Git. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).

## Multiple branches

If you have more than one Git branch, you need to merge the branches in your Git provider to copy work between environments. You can't copy work directly between environments in n8n. 

A common pattern is:

1. Do work in your developments instance.
1. Push the work to the development branch in Git.
1. Merge your development branch into your production branch.	Refer to the documentation for your Git provider for guidance on doing this:  
	* [GitHub: Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request){:target=_blank .external-link}
	* [GitLab: Creating merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html){:target=_blank .external-link}
	* [Git: Basic branching and merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging){:target=_blank .external-link}
1. In your production n8n instance, pull the changes. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).

## Automatically send changes to n8n

You can automate parts of the process of copying work, using the `/source-control/pull` API endpoint. Call the API after merging the changes:

```curl
curl --request POST \
	--location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \
	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	--header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \
	--data '{""force"": true}'
```

This means you can use a GitHub Action or GitLab CI/CD to automatically pull changes to the production instance on merge.

* [Push and pull](/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/): Send work to Git, and fetch work from Git to your instance. Understand what gets committed, and how n8n handles merge conflicts.
* [Copy work between environments](/source-control-environments/using/copy-work/): How to copy work between different n8n instances.

title: Manage variables
description: Manage variable values in n8n using the API and source control.
contentType: howto
---

# Manage variables

n8n doesn't sync variable values with Git. You must set up the credentials manually when setting up a new instance. You can choose to set up variables manually, or [using the API](#manage-variables-using-the-api).

## Manage variables using the API

n8n syncs variable names, but doesn't push variable values to your Git provider. You can either:

* Manually set variable values in n8n.
* Set variable values using the n8n API, using the `/pull` endpoint. 

Managing variables using the API has several advantages:

* You can automatically update variable values using a CI (continuous integration) tool. 
* You may also be able to protect the values. 

For example, you can store values in [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets){:target=_blank .external-link}, then populate the variables in n8n using an API call from a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions){:target=_blank .external-link}.

To manage variables using an API call, make a `POST` request to `/source-control/pull`:

```curl
	curl --location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \
	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	--header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \
	--data '{
	""force"": true,
	""variables"": { 
			""key1"": ""value1"",
			""key2"": ""value2""
	}
	}
	'
```

If the key already exists in n8n, the API call updates the value. If there is no variable with the key, it creates a new variable.

After setting values using the API, you can safely edit variables in n8n, and push and pull changes."

# Push and pull

If your n8n instance connects to a Git repository, you need to keep your work in sync with Git.

This document assumes some familiarity with Git concepts and terminology. Refer to [Git and n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/git/) for an introduction to how n8n works with Git.

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/one-direction.md""

## Fetch other people's work

/// note | Restricted to instance owners
Ordinary users can't fetch work from Git.
///
To pull work from Git, select **Pull** <span class=""inline-image"">![Pull icon](/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png){.off-glb}</span> in the main menu.

--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/push-pull-menu-state.md""

n8n may display a warning about overriding local changes. Select **Pull and override** to override your local work with the content in Git.

### Workflow and credential owner may change on pull

When you pull from Git to an n8n instance, n8n tries to assign workflows and credentials to a matching user or project.

If the original owner is a user:

If the same owner is available on both instances (matching email), the owner remains the same. If the original owner isn't on the new instance, n8n sets the user performing the pull as the workflow owner.

If the original owner is a [project](/user-management/rbac/):

n8n tries to match the original project name to a project name on the new instance. If no matching project exists, n8n creates a new project with the name, assigns the current user as project owner, and imports the workflows and credentials to the project.

### Pulling may cause brief service interruption

If you pull changes to an active workflow, n8n sets the workflow to inactive while pulling, then reactivates it. This may result in a few seconds of downtime for the workflow.

## Send your work to Git

/// note | Restricted to instance owners
Ordinary users can't send work to Git.
///
--8<-- ""_snippets/source-control-environments/push.md""

## What gets committed

n8n commits the following to Git:

* Workflows, including their tags and the email address of the workflow owner. You can choose which workflows to push.
* Credential stubs (ID, name, type)
* Variable stubs (ID and name)
* Projects

You can programmatically [Manage variables](/source-control-environments/using/manage-variables/) using the n8n API.

/// note | Coming soon: credential support with secret managers
n8n is working on support for external secret managers to handle credentials. Once this feature is complete, n8n will support linking the secret manager to multiple instances.
///
## Merge behaviors and conflicts

n8n's implementation of source control is opinionated. It resolves merge conflicts for credentials and variables automatically. n8n can't detect conflicts on workflows.

### Workflows

You have to explicitly tell n8n what to do about workflows when pushing or pulling. The Git repository acts as the source of truth.

When pulling, you might get warned that your local copy of a workflow differs from Git, and if you accept, your local copy would be overridden. Be careful not to lose relevant changes when pulling.

When you push, your local workflow will override what's in Git, so make sure that you have the most up to date version or you risk overriding recent changes.

To prevent the issue described above, you should immediately push your changes to a workflow once you finish working on it. Then it's safe to pull.

To avoid losing data:

* Design your source control setup so that workflows flow in one direction. For example, make edits on a development instance, push to Git, then pull to production. Don't make edits on the production instance and push them.
* Don't push all workflows. Select the ones you need.
* Be cautious about manually editing files in the Git repository.

### Credentials, variables and workflow tags

Credentials and variables can't have merge issues, as n8n chooses the version to keep.

On pull:

* If the tag, variable or credential doesn't exist, n8n creates it.
* If the tag, variable or credential already exists, n8n doesn't update it, unless:
	* You set the value of a variable using the API or externally. The new value overwrites any existing value.
	* The credential name has changed. n8n uses the version in Git.
	* The name of a tag has changed. n8n updates the tag name. Be careful when renaming tags as tag names are unique and this could cause database issues when it comes to uniqueness during the pull process.

On push:

* n8n overwrites the entire variables and tags files.
* If a credential already exists, n8n overwrites it with the changes, but doesn't apply these changes to existing credentials on pull.

/// note | Manage credentials with an external secrets vault
If you need different credentials on different n8n environments, use [External secrets](/external-secrets/).

# A slightly longer introduction

This guide shows you how to automate a task using a workflow in n8n, explaining key concepts along the way. You will:

* Create a workflow from scratch. You'll build a workflow that runs every week to get data from NASA, filters the data, and generates two reports.
* Understand key concepts and skills, including:
    * Starting workflows with trigger nodes
    * Configuring credentials
    * Manipulating data
    * Representing logic in an n8n workflow
    * Using expressions


## Step one: Sign up for n8n

--8<-- ""_snippets/try-it-out/install-run-n8n.md""

## Step two: New workflow

--8<-- ""_snippets/try-it-out/new-workflow.md""


## Step three: Add a trigger node

n8n provides two ways to start a workflow:

* Manually, by selecting **Test Workflow**, or from the CLI if you installed n8n with npm or Docker.
* Automatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings.

For this tutorial, use the [Schedule trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/). This allows you to run the workflow on a schedule:

1. Select **Add first step**.
2. Search for **Schedule**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
3. Select **Schedule Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
4. For **Trigger Interval**, select **Weeks**.
5. For **Weeks Between Triggers**, enter `1`.
6. Enter a time and day. For this example, select **Monday** in **Trigger on Weekdays**, select **9am** in **Trigger at Hour**, and enter `0` in **Trigger at Minute**.
7. Close the node details view to return to the canvas.


## Step four: Add the NASA node and set up credentials

The [NASA node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.nasa/) allows you to interact with NASA's [public APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/){:target=_blank .external-link}. The API gives you data to work with in this tutorial.

1. Select the **Add node** <span class=""inline-image"">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector on the Schedule Trigger node.
2. Search for **NASA**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
3. Select **NASA** to view a list of operations.
4. Search for and select **Get a DONKI solar flare**. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
5. To access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials:
    1. Select the  **Credential for NASA API** dropdown.
    2. Select **- Create New -**. n8n opens the credentials view.
    3. Go to [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/){:target=_blank .external-link} and fill out the form in **Generate API Key**. NASA generates the key and displays it.
    4. Copy the key, and paste it into **API Key** in n8n.
    5. Select **Save**.
    6. Close the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in **Credential for NASA API**.
6. By default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use **Additional Fields**:
    1. Select **Add field**.
    2. Select **Start date**.
    3. To get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to **Start date**, select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button <span class=""inline-image"">![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the full expressions editor.
    4. In the **Expression** field, enter the following expression:
    ```js
    {{$today.minus({days: 7}).toFormat('yyyy-MM-dd')}}
    ```
    This generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date.

    /// note | Date and time in n8n
    n8n uses Luxon to work with date and time, and also provides two variables for convenience: `$now` and `$today`. For more information, refer to [Expressions > Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon/). 
    ///

7. Close the **Edit Expression** modal to return to the NASA node.
8. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Test step** to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the **OUTPUT** section.
9. Close the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas.

## Step five: Add logic with the If node

n8n supports complex logic in workflows. In this tutorial, use the [If node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if) to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications. You'll create logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another. 

Add the If node:

1. Select the **Add node** <span class=""inline-image"">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector on the NASA node.
1. Search for **If**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
1. Select **If** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
1. You need to check the value of the `classType` property in the NASA data. To do this:
	1. Drag **classType** into **Value 1**.

		/// note | Make sure you ran the NASA node in the previous section
		If you didn't follow the step in the previous section to run the NASA node, you won't see any data to work with in this step.
		///

    2. Change the comparison operation to **Contains**.
    3. In **Value 2**, enter **X**. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares.
1. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Test step** to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the **OUTPUT** panel.

/// note | Weeks without large solar flares
In this tutorial, you are working with live date. If you find there aren't any X class solar flares when you run the workflow, try replacing **X** in **Value 2** with either **A**, **B**, **C**, or **M**. 
///

## Step six: Output data from your workflow

The last step of the workflow is to send the two reports about solar flares. For this example, you'll send data to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/){:target=_blank .external-link}. Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page. 

1. On the If node, select the **Add node** <span class=""inline-image"">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node.png){.off-glb}</span> connector labeled **true**.
1. Search for **PostBin**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
1. Select **PostBin**.
1. Select **Send a request**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
1. Go to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/){:target=_blank .external-link} and select **Create Bin**. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow.
1. Copy the bin ID. It looks similar to `1651063625300-2016451240051`.
1. In n8n, paste your Postbin ID into **Bin ID**.
1. Now, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to **Bin Content**, select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button <span class=""inline-image"">![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the full expressions editor.
1. Select **Current Node** > **Input Data** > **JSON** > **classType**. n8n adds the expression to the **Expression** editor, and displays a sample output.
1. The expression is: `{{$json[""classType""]}}`. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is:
    ```js
    There was a solar flare of class {{$json[""classType""]}}
    ```
1. Close the expressions editor to return to the node.
1. Close the Postbin node to return to the canvas.
1. Add another Postbin node, to handle the **false** output path from the If node:
    1. Hover over the Postbin node, then select **Node context menu** <span class=""inline-image"">![Node context menu icon](/_images/common-icons/node-context-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> > **Duplicate node** to duplicate the first Postbin node.
    2. Drag the **false** connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node.

## Step seven: Test the workflow

1. You can now test the entire workflow. Select **Test Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress.
2. Go back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output.
3. If you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to activate it by selecting the **Active** toggle.

/// note | Time limit
Postbin's bins exist for 30 minutes after creation. You may need to create a new bin and update the ID in the Postbin nodes, if you exceed this time limit.

# The very quick quickstart

This quickstart gives you a quick taste of n8n. Its aim is to allow you to try out the UI, and introduce you to two key features: workflow templates and expressions. It doesn't include detailed explanations or explore concepts.

You will:

* Load a workflow from the workflow templates library
* Add a node and configure it using expressions.
* Run your first workflow

## Step one: Sign up for n8n

--8<-- ""_snippets/try-it-out/install-run-n8n.md""

## Step two: Open a workflow template

n8n provides a quickstart template using training nodes. This allows you to work with fake data, and avoids setting up credentials.

1. Go to [Templates | Very quick quickstart](https://n8n.io/workflows/1700-very-quick-quickstart/){:target=_blank .external-link}.
1. Select **Use workflow** to view the options for using the template.
1. Select **Import template to <name> cloud workspace** to load the template into your Cloud instance.

This workflow:

1. Gets example data from the Customer Datastore node.
2. Uses the Edit Fields node to extract just the data you want, and assign that data to variables. In this example, you use the customer name, ID, and description.

The individual pieces in an n8n workflow are called nodes. Double click a node to explore its settings and how it processes data.

## Step three: Run the workflow

Select **Test Workflow**. This runs the workflow, loading the data from the Customer Datastore node, then transforming it with Edit Fields. You need this data available in the workflow so that you can work with it in the next step.

## Step four: Add a node

Add a third node to message each customer and tell them their description. Use the Customer Messenger node to send a message to fake recipients.

1. Select the **Add node** <span class=""inline-image"">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector on the Edit Fields node.
2. Search for **Customer Messenger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
3. Select **Customer Messenger (n8n training)** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node automatically.
4. Use [expressions](/code/expressions/) to map in the **Customer ID** and create the **Message**:
	1. Drag **customer_id** from the **INPUT** panel into the **Customer ID** field in the node settings.
    2. Hover over **Message**. Select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button <span class=""inline-image"">![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the full expressions editor.
    3. Copy this expression into the editor:
        ```
        Hi {{$json.customer_name}},  Your description is {{$json.customer_description}}
        ```
5. Close the expressions editor, then close the **Customer Messenger** node by clicking outside the node or selecting **Back to canvas**.
6. Select **Test Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow.

The complete workflow should look like this:

![Screenshot of completed quickstart workflow](/_images/try-it-out/quickstart/very-quick-quickstart-workflow.png)

# Best practices for user management

This page contains advice on best practices relating to user management in n8n.

## All platforms

* n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.
* Users must be careful not to edit the same workflow simultaneously. It's possible to do it, but the users will overwrite each other's changes.
* To move workflows between accounts, export the workflow as JSON, then import it to the new account. Note that this action loses the workflow history.
* Webhook paths must be unique across the entire instance. This means each webhook path must be unique for all workflows and all users. By default, n8n generates a long random value for the webhook path, but users can edit this to their own custom path. If two users set the same path value:
    * The path works for the first workflow that's run or activated.
    * Other workflows will error if they try to run with the same path.

## Self-hosted

If you run n8n behind a reverse proxy, set the following environment variables so that n8n generates emails with the correct URL:

* `N8N_HOST`
* `N8N_PORT`
* `N8N_PROTOCOL`
* `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`  

More information on these variables is available in [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/)."

# User management

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance. It includes:

# Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

/// info | Feature availability
* Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.
* You need access to the n8n instance owner account.
///

This page tells you how to enable LDAP in n8n. It assumes you're familiar with LDAP, and have an existing LDAP server set up.

LDAP allows users to sign in to n8n with their organization credentials, instead of an n8n login.

## Enable LDAP

1. Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
2. Select **Settings** <span class=""inline-image"">![Settings icon](/_images/common-icons/settings.png){.off-glb}</span> > **LDAP**.
3. Toggle on **Enable LDAP Login**.
4. Complete the fields with details from your LDAP server.
5. Select **Test connection** to check your connection setup, or **Save connection** to create the connection.

After enabling LDAP, anyone on your LDAP server can sign in to the n8n instance, unless you exclude them using the **User Filter** setting.

You can still create non-LDAP users (email users) on the **Settings** > **Users** page.

## Merging n8n and LDAP accounts

If n8n finds matching accounts (matching emails) for email users and LDAP users, the user must sign in with their LDAP account. n8n instance owner accounts are excluded from this: n8n never converts owner accounts to LDAP users.

## LDAP user accounts in n8n

On first sign in, n8n creates a user account in n8n for the LDAP user.

You must manage user details on the LDAP server, not in n8n. If you update or delete a user on your LDAP server, the n8n account updates at the next scheduled sync, or when the user next tries to log in, whichever happens first.

/// note | User deletion
If you remove a user from your LDAP server, they lose n8n access on the next sync.
///
## Turn LDAP off

To turn LDAP off:

1. Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
2. Select **Settings** <span class=""inline-image"">![Settings icon](/_images/common-icons/settings.png){.off-glb}</span> > **LDAP**.
3. Toggle off **Enable LDAP Login**.

If you turn LDAP off, n8n converts existing LDAP users to email users on their next login. The users must reset their password."

# Two-factor authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second authentication method on top of username and password. This increases account security. n8n supports 2FA using an authenticator app.

## Enable 2FA

You need an authenticator app on your phone.

To enable 2FA in n8n:

1. Go to you **Settings** > **Personal**.
2. Select **Enable 2FA**. n8n opens a modal with a QR code.
3. Scan the QR code in your authenticator app.
4. Enter the code from your app in **Code from authenticator app**.
5. Select **Continue**. n8n displays recovery codes.
6. Save the recovery codes. You need these to regain access to your account if you lose your authenticator.

## Disable 2FA for your instance

Self-hosted users can configure their n8n instance to disable 2FA for all users by setting `N8N_MFA_ENABLED` to false. Note that n8n ignores this if existing users have 2FA enabled. Refer to [Configuration methods](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on configuring your n8n instance with environment variables."

///

n8n uses projects to group workflows and credentials, and assigns [roles](/user-management/rbac/role-types/) to users in each project. This means that a single user can have different roles in different projects, giving them different levels of access.

## Create a project

Instance owners and instance admins can create projects.

To create a project:

1. Select <span class=""inline-image"">![Plus icon](/_images/common-icons/plus.png)</span> **Add project**.
1. Fill out the project settings.
1. Select **Save**.

## Add and remove users in a project

Project admins can add and remove users.

To add a user to a project:

1. Select the project.
1. Select **Project settings**.
1. Under **Project members**, browse for users or search by username or email address.
1. Select the user you want to add.
1. Check the [role type](/user-management/rbac/role-type/) and change it if needed.
1. Select **Save**.

To remove a user from a project:

1. Select the project.
1. Select **Project settings**.
1. In the role type dropdown for the user you want to remove, select **Remove access**.
1. Select **Save**.

## Delete a project

To delete a project:

1. Select the project.
1. Select **Project settings**.
1. Select **Delete project**.
1. Choose what to do with the workflows and credentials. You can select:
	* **Transfer its workflows and credentials to another project**: n8n prompts you to choose a project to move the data to.
	* **Delete its workflows and credentials**: n8n prompts you to confirm that you want to delete all the data in the project.

## Move workflows and credentials between projects or users

Workflow and credential owners can move workflows or credentials (changing ownership) to other users or projects they have access to.

1. Select **Workflow menu** <span class=""inline-image"">![Workflow menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> or **Credential menu** <span class=""inline-image"">![Workflow menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> > **Move**.
1. Select the project or user you want to move to.
1. Select **Next**.
1. Confirm you understand the impact of the move: workflows may stop working if the credentials they need aren't available in the target project, and n8n removes any current individual sharing.
1. Select **Confirm move to new project**.

## Using external secrets in projects

To use [external secrets](/external-secrets/) in a project, you must have an [instance owner or instance admin](/user-management/account-types/) as a member of the project."

# RBAC role types

/// info | Feature availability
* The Project Editor role is available on Pro Cloud and Self-hosted Enterprise plans. 
* The Project Viewer role is only available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.
///

Within projects, there are three user roles: Admin, Editor, and Viewer. These roles control what the user can do in a project. A user can have different roles within different projects.

## Project Admin

A Project Admin role has the highest level of permissions. Project admins can:

* Manage project settings: Change name, delete project.
* Manage project members: Invite members and remove members, change members' roles.
* View, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project. 

## Project Editor

A Project Editor can view, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project. 

## Project Viewer

A Project Viewer is effectively a `read-only` role with access to all workflows, credentials, and executions within a project.

Viewers aren't able to manually execute any workflows that exist in a project.

# Set up SAML

/// info | Feature availability
* Available on Enterprise plans.
* You need access to the n8n instance owner account to enable and configure SAML

Available from version 0.225.0.
///	

This page tells you how to enable SAML SSO (single sign-on) in n8n. It assumes you're familiar with SAML. If you're not, [SAML Explained in Plain English](https://www.onelogin.com/learn/saml){:target=_blank .external-link} can help you understand how SAML works, and its benefits.

## Enable SAML

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **SSO**.
1. Make a note of the n8n **Redirect URL** and **Entity ID**.
	1. **Optional**: if your IdP allows you to set up SAML from imported metadata, navigate to the **Entity ID** URL and save the XML. 
	2. **Optional**: if you are running n8n behind a load balancer make sure you have `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL` configured. 
1. Set up SAML with your IdP (identity provider). You need the redirect URL and entity ID. You may also need an email address and name for the IdP user.
1. After completing setup in your IdP, load the metadata XML into n8n. You can use a metadata URL or raw XML:
	1. **Metadata URL**: Copy the metadata URL from your IdP into the **Identity Provider Settings** field in n8n.
	1. **Raw XML**: Download the metadata XML from your IdP, toggle **Identiy Provider Settings** to **XML**, then copy the raw XML into **Identity Provider Settings**.
1. Select **Save settings**.
1. Select **Test settings** to check your SAML setup is working.
1. Set SAML 2.0 to **Activated**.

## Generic IdP setup

The steps to configure the IdP vary depending on your chosen IdP. These are some common setup tasks:

* Create an app for n8n in your IdP.
* Map n8n attributes to IdP attributes:

	| Name | Name format | Value (IdP side) |
	| ---- | ----------- | ---------------- |
	| http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress | URI Reference | User email       |
	| http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/firstname    | URI Reference | User First Name  |
	| http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/lastname     | URI Reference | User Last Name   |
	| http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn          | URI Reference | User Email       |

# Troubleshooting SAML SSO

If you get an error when testing your SAML setup, check the following:

* Does the app you created in your IdP support SAML?
* Did you enter the n8n redirect URL and entity ID in the correct fields in your IdP?
* Is the metadata XML correct? Check that the metadata you copied into n8n is formatted correctly.

For more support, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/){:target=_blank .external-link}, or contact your support representative if you have a paid support plan."

# Create a workflow

A workflow is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process. You build workflows on the workflow canvas.

## Create a workflow

1. Select the <span class=""inline-image"">![universal create resource icon](/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png){.off-glb}</span> **button** in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select workflow.
2. If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the workflow inside your **personal space** or a specific **project** you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll always create workflows inside your personal space.
3. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

Or:

1. Select the  <span class=""inline-image"">![universal create resource icon](/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png){.off-glb}</span> **create** button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific **project**. Select workflow.
2. If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the workflow inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the workflow inside that specific project.
3. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

If it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the [quickstart guides](/try-it-out/) to quickly try out n8n features.

## Run workflows manually

You may need to run your workflow manually when building and testing, or if your workflow doesn't have a trigger node. 

To run manually, select **Test Workflow**.

## Run workflows automatically

All new workflows are inactive by default.

You need to activate workflows that start with a trigger node or Webhook node so that they can run automatically. When a workflow is inactive, you must run it manually.

To activate or deactivate your workflow, open your workflow and toggle **Inactive** / **Active**.

Once a workflow is active, it runs whenever its trigger conditions are met."

# Export and import workflows

n8n saves workflows in JSON format. You can export your workflows as JSON files or import JSON files into your n8n library. 
You can export and import workflows in several ways. 

--8<-- ""_snippets/workflows/sharing-credentials.md""

## Copy-Paste

You can copy and paste a workflow or parts of it by selecting the nodes you want to copy to the clipboard (`Ctrl + c` or `cmd +c`) and pasting it (`Ctrl + v` or `cmd + v`) into the Editor UI.

To select all nodes or a group of nodes, click and drag:
  ![Select a group of nodes](/_images/workflows/export-import/selectingnodes.gif)

## From the Editor UI menu

From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right <img alt=""Workflow menu icon"" class=""off-glb"" src=""/_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png""> to see the following options:

# Workflow history

/// info | Feature availability
* Full workflow history is available on Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Self-hosted.
* Versions from the last five days are available for Cloud Pro users.
* Versions from the last 24 hours are available for registered Community users.
///	

Use workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows. 

## Understand workflow history

n8n creates a new version when you:

 * Save your workflow.
 * Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.
 * Pull from a Git repository using [Source control](/source-control-environments/). Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.

/// note | Workflow history and execution history
Don't confuse workflow history with the [Workflow-level executions list](/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](/workflows/executions/debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.
///


## View workflow history

To view a workflow's history:

1. Open the workflow.
1. Select **Workflow history** <span class=""inline-image"">![Workflow history icon](/_images/common-icons/workflow-history.png){.off-glb}</span>. n8n opens a menu showing the saved workflow versions, and a canvas with a preview of the selected version.

## Restore or copy previous versions

You can restore a previous workflow version, or make a copy of it:

1. On the version you want to restore or copy, select **Options** <span class=""inline-image"">![Options icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span>.
1. Choose what you want to do:
	* **Restore this version**: replace your current workflow with the selected version.
	* **Clone to new workflow**: create a new workflow based on the selected version.
	* **Open version in new tab**: open a second tab displaying the selected version. Use this to compare versions.
	* **Download**: download the version as JSON."

# Workflow settings

You can customize workflow behavior for individual workflows using workflow settings.

To open the settings:

1. Open your workflow.
2. Select the **Options** <span class=""inline-image"">![Options menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> menu.
3. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.


The following settings are available:

* **Execution order**: choose the execution order for multi-branch workflows. **v0 (legacy)** executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on. **v1 (recommended)** executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the canvas, from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.
* **Error Workflow**: select a workflow to trigger if the current workflow fails. See [Error workflows](/flow-logic/error-handling/) for more details.
* **This workflow can be called by**: choose whether other workflow can call this workflow. Requires [Workflow sharing](/workflows/sharing/).
* **Timezone**: sets the timezone for the workflow to use. The default timezone is EDT (New York). The timezone setting is  important for the Schedule Trigger node.
* **Save failed production executions**: whether n8n should save failed executions for active workflows.
* **Save successful production executions**: whether n8n should save successful executions for active workflows.
* **Save manual executions**: whether n8n should save executions for workflows started by the user in the editor.
* **Save execution progress**: whether n8n should save execution data for each node. If set to **Save**, the workflow resumes from where it stopped in case of an error. This might increase latency.
* **Timeout Workflow**: toggle to enable setting a duration after which n8n should cancel the current workflow execution.
	* **Timeout After**: Set the time in hours, minutes, and seconds after which the workflow should timeout. For n8n Cloud users n8n enforces a maximum available timeout for each plan."

# Workflow sharing

/// info | Feature availability
Available on Pro and Enterprise Cloud plans, and Enterprise self-hosted plans.
///

Workflow sharing allows you to share workflows between users of the same n8n instance.

Users can share workflows they created. Instance owners, and users with the admin role, can view and share all workflows in the instance. Refer to [Account types](/user-management/account-types/) for more information about owners and admins.

## Share a workflow

1. Open the workflow you want to share.
2. Select **Share**.
3. In **Add users**, find and select the users you want to share with.
4. Select **Save**.

## View shared workflows

You can browse and search workflows on the **Workflows** list. The workflows in the list depend on the project:

* **Overview** lists all workflows you can access. This includes:
	* Your own workflows.
	* Workflows shared with you.
	* Workflows in projects you're a member of.
	* If you log in as the instance owner or admin: all workflows in the instance.
* Other projects: all workflows in the project.

## Workflow roles and permissions

There are two workflow roles: creator and editor. The creator is the user who created the workflow. Editors are other users with access to the workflow.

You can't change the workflow owner, except when deleting the user.

/// note | Credentials
Workflow sharing allows editors to use all credentials used in the workflow. This includes credentials that aren't explicitly shared with them using [credential sharing](/credentials/credential-sharing/).
///
### Permissions

| Permissions | Creator | Editor | 
| ----------- | ------- | ------ | 
| View workflow (read-only) | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| View executions | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |

## Node editing restrictions with unshared credentials

Sharing in n8n works on the principle of least privilege. This means that if a user shares a workflow with you, but they don't share their credentials, you can't edit the nodes within the workflow that use those credentials. You can view and run the workflow, and edit nodes that don't use unshared credentials.

Refer to [Credential sharing](/credentials/credential-sharing/) for guidance on sharing credentials."

# Tags

Workflow tags allow you to label your workflows. You can then filter workflows by tag.

Tags are global. This means when you create a tag, it's available to all users on your n8n instance.

## Add a tag to a workflow

To add a tag to your workflow:

1. In your workflow, select **+ Add tag**.
2. Select an existing tag, or enter a new tag name.
3. Once you select a tag and click away from the tag modal, n8n displays the tag next to the workflow name.

You can add more than one tag.

## Filter by tag

When browsing the workflows on your instance, you can filter by tag.

1. On the **Workflows** page, select **Filters**.
2. Select **Tags**.
3. Select the tag or tags you want to filter by. n8n lists the workflows with that tag.

## Manage tags

You can edit existing tags. Instance owners can delete tags.

1. Select **Manage tags**. This is available from **Filters** > **Tags** on the **Workflows** page, or in the **+ Add tag** modal in your workflow.
2. Hover over the tag you want to change.
3. Select **Edit** <span class=""inline-image"">![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/edit.png){.off-glb}</span> to rename it, or **Delete** <span class=""inline-image"">![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/delete.png){.off-glb}</span> to delete it.

# Workflow templates

When creating a new workflow, you can choose whether to start with an empty workflow, or use an existing template.

Templates provide:

* Help getting started: n8n might already have a template that does what you need.
* Examples of what you can build
* Best practices for creating your own workflows

## Access templates

Select <span class=""inline-image"">![View templates icon](/_images/common-icons/templates.png){.off-glb}</span> **Templates** to view the templates library.

If you use n8n's template library, this takes you to browse [Workflows on the n8n website](https://n8n.io/workflows/){:target=_blank .external-link}. If you use a custom library provided by your organization, you'll be able to search and browse the templates within the app.

# Nodes

Nodes are the key building blocks of a workflow. They perform a range of actions, including:

* Starting the workflow.
* Fetching and sending data.
* Processing and manipulating data.

n8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, as well as the ability to create your own nodes. Refer to:

* [Built-in integrations](/integrations/builtin/node-types/) to browse the node library.
* [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on finding and installing community-created nodes.
* [Creating nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) to start building your own nodes.


## Add a node to your workflow

### Add a node to an empty workflow

1. Select **Add first step**. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse trigger nodes.
2. Select the trigger you want to use.

    /// note | Choose the correct app event
	If you select **On App Event**, n8n shows a list of all the supported services. Use this list to browse n8n's integrations and trigger a workflow in response to an event in your chosen service. Not all integrations have triggers. To see which ones you can use as a trigger, select the node. If a trigger is available, you'll see it at the top of the available operations list.

	For example, this is the trigger for Asana:

	![Screenshot of the Asana node operations list, showing the Recommended section at the top of the list](/_images/workflows/components/nodes/recommended-trigger.png)
	///

### Add a node to an existing workflow

Select the **Add node** <span class=""inline-image"">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse all nodes.

--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/node-operations.md""

## Node controls

To view node controls, hover over the node on the canvas:

* **Test step** <span class=""inline-image"">![Test step icon](/_images/common-icons/play-node.png){.off-glb}</span>: Run the node.
* **Deactivate** <span class=""inline-image"">![Deactivate node icon](/_images/common-icons/power-off.png){.off-glb}</span>: Deactivate the node.
* **Delete** <span class=""inline-image"">![Delete node icon](/_images/common-icons/delete-node.png){.off-glb}</span>: Delete the node.
* **Node context menu** <span class=""inline-image"">![Node context menu icon](/_images/common-icons/node-context-menu.png){.off-glb}</span>: Select node actions. Available actions:

	* Test step
	* Rename node
	* Deactivate node
	* Pin node
	* Copy node
	* Duplicate node
	* Select all
	* Clear selection
	* Delete node

## Node settings

The node settings under the **Settings** tab allow you to control node behaviors and add node notes.

When active or set, they do the following:

* **Request Options**: Select **Add Option** to view and select these options. 
	- **Batching**: Control how to batch large numbers of input items.
	- **Ignore SSL Issues**: Download the response even if SSL validation isn't possible.
	- **Proxy**: Use this if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.
	- **Timeout**: Set a timeout for the request in ms. 
* **Always Output Data**: The node returns an empty item even if the node returns no data during execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.
* **Execute Once**: The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.
* **Retry On Fail**: When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds. 
* **On Error**: 
    - **Stop Workflow**: Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.
    - **Continue**: Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.
    - **Continue (using error output)**: Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.

You can document your workflow using node notes:

* **Notes**: Note to save with the node.
* **Display note in flow**: If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle."

# Sticky Notes

Sticky Notes allow you to annotate and comment on your workflows.

n8n recommends using Sticky Notes heavily, especially on template workflows, to help other users understand your workflow.

![Screenshot of a basic workflow with an example sticky note](/_images/workflows/components/stickies/example-sticky-note.png)

## Create a Sticky Note

Sticky Notes are a core node. To add a new Sticky Note:

1. Open the nodes panel.
2. Search for `note`.
3. Click the **Sticky Note** node. n8n adds a new Sticky Note to the canvas.

## Edit a Sticky Note

1. Double click the Sticky Note you want to edit.
2. Write your note. [This guide](https://commonmark.org/help/) explains how to format your text with Markdown. n8n uses [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), which implements the CommonMark specification. 
3. Click away from the note, or press `Esc`, to stop editing.

## Change the color

To change the Sticky Note color:

1. Hover over the Sticky Note
1. Select **Change color** <span class=""inline-image"">![Change Sticky Note color icon](/_images/common-icons/change-color.png){.off-glb}</span>

## Sticky Note positioning

You can:

* Drag a Sticky Note anywhere on the canvas.
* Drag Sticky Notes behind nodes. You can use this to visually group nodes.
* Resize Sticky Notes by hovering over the edge of the note and dragging to resize.
* Change the color: select **Options** <span class=""inline-image"">![Options icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the color selector.

## Writing in Markdown

Sticky Notes support Markdown formatting. This section describes some common options.

```
The text in double asterisks will be **bold**

The text in single asterisks will be *italic*

Use # to indicate headings:
# This is a top-level heading

# All executions

To view **all executions** from an n8n instance, navigate to the **Overview** page and then click into the Executions tab. This will show you all executions from the workflows you have access to.

If your n8n instance supports **projects**, you'll also be able to view the executions tab within projects you have access to. This will show you executions only from the workflows within the specified project.

/// note | Deleted workflows
When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.
///

## Filter executions

You can filter the executions list:

1. Select the **Executions** tab either from within the **Overview** page or a specific **project** to open the list.
2. Select **Filters**.
3. Enter your filters. You can filter by:
	* **Workflows**: choose all workflows, or a specific workflow name.
	* **Status**: choose from **Failed**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**.
	* **Execution start**: see executions that started in the given time.
	* **Saved custom data**: this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to [Custom executions data](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/) for information on adding custom data.

--8<-- ""_snippets/workflows/executions/custom-execution-data-availability.md""

## Retry failed workflows

If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:

1. Select the **Executions** tab from within either the **Overview** page or a specific **project** to open the list. 
2. On the execution you want to retry, select **Retry execution** <span class=""inline-image"">![Options menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span>.

description: Add custom data to your workflow executions using the Code node. You can then filter executions by this data.
contentType: howto
---

# Custom executions data

You can set custom data on your workflow using the Code node or the [Execution Data node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/). n8n records this with each execution. You can then use this data when filtering the executions list, or fetch it in your workflows using the Code node.

--8<-- ""_snippets/workflows/executions/custom-execution-data-availability.md""

## Set and access custom data using the Code node

This section describes how to set and access data using the Code node. Refer to [Execution Data node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) for information on using the Execution Data node to set data. You can't retrieve custom data using the Execution Data node.

### Set custom executions data

Set a single piece of extra data:

=== ""JavaScript""
	```js
	$execution.customData.set(""key"", ""value"");
	```
=== ""Python""
	```python
	_execution.customData.set(""key"", ""value"");
	```

Set all extra data. This overwrites the whole custom data object for this execution:

=== ""JavaScript""
	```js
	$execution.customData.setAll({""key1"": ""value1"", ""key2"": ""value2""})
	```
=== ""Python""
	```python
	_execution.customData.setAll({""key1"": ""value1"", ""key2"": ""value2""})
	```

There are limitations:

* They must be strings
* `key` has a maximum length of 50 characters
* `value` has a maximum length of 255 characters
* n8n supports a maximum of 10 items of custom data

### Access the custom data object during execution

You can retrieve the custom data object, or a specific value in it, during an execution:

<!-- vale off -->
=== ""JavaScript""
	```js
	// Access the current state of the object during the execution
	const customData = $execution.customData.getAll();

	// Access a specific value set during this execution
	const customData = $execution.customData.get(""key"");
	```
=== ""Python""
	```python
	# Access the current state of the object during the execution
	customData = _execution.customData.getAll();

	# Access a specific value set during this execution
	customData = _execution.customData.get(""key"");
	```
<!-- vale on -->"

# Debug and re-run past executions

/// info | Feature availability
Available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.
///

You can load data from a previous execution into your current workflow. This is useful for debugging data from failed production executions: you can see a failed execution, make changes to your workflow to fix it, then re-run it with the previous execution data.

## Load data

To load data from a previous execution:

1. In your workflow, select the **Executions** tab to view the **Executions** list.
1. Select the execution you want to debug. n8n displays options depending on whether the workflow was successful or failed:
	* For failed executions: select **Debug in editor**.
	* For successful executions: select **Copy to editor**.
1. n8n copies the execution data into your current workflow, and [pins the data](/data/data-pinning/) in the first node in the workflow.

/// note | Check which executions you save
The executions available on the **Executions** list depends on your [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings/).

# Executions

An execution is a single run of a workflow.

## Execution modes

There are two execution modes:

* Manual: run workflows manually when testing. Select **Test Workflow** to start a manual execution. You can do manual executions of active workflows, but n8n recommends keeping your workflow set to **Inactive** while developing and testing.
* Production: a production workflow is one that runs automatically. To enable this, set the workflow to **Active**.


## Execution lists

n8n provides two execution lists:

* [Workflow-level executions](/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/): this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.
* [All executions](/workflows/executions/all-executions/): this list shows all executions for all your workflows.

n8n supports [adding custom data to executions](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/)."

contentType: howto

# Workflow-level executions list

The **Executions** list in a workflow shows all executions for that workflow.

/// note | Deleted workflows
When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.
///

/// note | Execution history and workflow history
Don't confuse the execution list with [Workflow history](/workflows/history/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](/workflows/executions/debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.
///


## View executions for a single workflow

In the workflow, select the **Executions** tab in the top menu. You can preview all executions of that workflow.

## Filter executions

You can filter the executions list.

1. In your workflow, select **Executions**.	
2. Select **Filters**.
3. Enter your filters. You can filter by:
	* **Status**: choose from **Failed**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**.
	* **Execution start**: see executions that started in the given time.
	* **Saved custom data**: this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to [Custom executions data](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/) for information on adding custom data.

## Retry failed workflows

If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:

1. Open the **Executions** list.
2. For the workflow execution you want to retry, select **Refresh** <span class=""inline-image"">![Refresh icon](/_images/common-icons/refresh.png){.off-glb}</span>.

# How to use this template

1. Make a new branch. If working on an internal ticket, include it at the start of the name. For example, DOC-123-feature-summary.
2. Create a new file, or find the file you want to edit, in integrations/builtin/app-nodes/. If creating a new file, pay attention to the naming conventions: it should match the node name in the codex file. For example, in the Active Campaign node, the codex file (https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/ActiveCampaign/ActiveCampaign.node.json) reads: `""node"": ""n8n-nodes-base.activeCampaign""`. So the app node file name is n8n-nodes-base.activeCampaign.
3. Copy the template into the file (don't copy this comment).
4. Placeholder text is in _italic_ or between <>. Make sure to replace it! 
5. Before publishing, delete any comments.

Use the style guide: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/wiki

# _Name_ credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* _List of apps_
* _That use these credentials_

<!--if this is a credential-only node, use this snippet instead-->
--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cred-only-statement.md""

<!-- If this credential has numerous prerequisites, include the Prerequisites section below and remove the account reference in the in the Using_Auth method_ section.
If a single prereq. like having an account, delete the Prerequisites section here and just update the intro statement in the Using _Auth method_ section -->
## Prerequisites

_Include info on services they need to sign up for or required account settings/permissions_

## Supported authentication methods

* _List of supported auth methods. Identify if methods should only be used for certain purposes_

## Related resources

<!-- add a link to the service's documentation. This should usually go directly to the API credential docs. Amend the link text if necessary. -->
Refer to [_Name_'s API documentation](){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.


<!-- If this is a credential-only node, add a link to the node page on n8n's website. For example: https://n8n.io/integrations/gmail/ 
This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations/) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/_Name_/){:target=_blank .external-link} on n8n's website. -->


## Using _Auth method_

To configure this credential, you'll need a _add link to account login or app page_ account and:

- _List of fields they'll need to fill out within n8n and a brief description of what those fields are_

<!-- For ""Medium,"" ""High,"" or ""Critical"" credentials, use this section. For ""Low"" credentials, delete it. -->
_Add an intro statement that makes sense. For example: To generate an access token, create a Slack app:_

1. _Detailed numbered instructions to configure credential. Add links to specific docs here if there are any that are relevant._

<!-- For all credentials, include a link to the service's documentation on this type of authentication. This usually goes directly to API credentials, OAuth, etc.
Amend the link/sentence text as necessary. -->
Refer to [_Name_'s API documentation](){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about authenticating to the service.

<!-- IF OAUTH FOR CLOUD-HOSTED DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY SETUP, use the section below. Otherwise omit -->
--8<-- ""_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cloud-oauth-button.md""

<!-- If OAuth method, self-hosted usually needs to configure OAuth from scratch. -->
<!-- For low or unprioritized credentials, use this statement and delete the next one -->
If you're [self-hosting](/hosting/) n8n, you'll need to _create an app_ to configure OAuth2. Refer to [_Name_'s OAuth documentation](){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about setting up OAuth2.

<!-- For Medium, High, or Critical credentials, use this section: -->
If you're [self-hosting](/hosting/) n8n, you'll need to _create an app_ to configure OAuth2. To do so:

# How to use this template

1. Make a new branch. If working on an internal ticket, include it at the start of the name. For example, DOC-123-feature-summary.
2. Create a new file, or find the file you want to edit, in integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/. If creating a new file, pay attention to the naming conventions: it should match the node name in the codex file. For example, in the Active Campaign Trigger node, the codex file (https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/ActiveCampaign/ActiveCampaignTrigger.node.json) reads: `""node"": ""n8n-nodes-base.activeCampaignTrigger""`. So the app node file name is n8n-nodes-base.activeCampaignTrigger.
3. Copy the template into the file (don't copy this comment).
4. Placeholder text is in _italic_ or between <>. Make sure to replace it! 
5. Before publishing, delete any comments.

///"
item-linking-code-node,"Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. It also has implications when using the Code node. Most nodes link every output item to an input item. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. For a deeper conceptual overview of this topic, refer to [Item linking concepts](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts). This document focuses on practical usage examples.

When using the Code node, there are some scenarios where you need to manually supply item linking information if you want to be able to use `$(""<node-name>"").item` later in the workflow. All these scenarios only apply if you have more than one incoming item. n8n automatically handles item linking for single items.

These scenarios are when you:

* Add new items: the new items aren't linked to any input.
* Return new items.
* Want to manually control the item linking.

[n8n's automatic item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) handles the other scenarios.

To control item linking, set `pairedItem` when returning data. For example, to link to the item at index 0:

```js
[
	{
		""json"": {
			. . . 
		},
		// The index of the input item that generated this output item
		""pairedItem"": 0
	}
]
```


### `pairedItem` usage example

Take this input data:

```json
[
  {
    ""id"": ""23423532"",
    ""name"": ""Jay Gatsby""
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423533"",
    ""name"": ""José Arcadio Buendía""
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423534"",
    ""name"": ""Max Sendak""
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423535"",
    ""name"": ""Zaphod Beeblebrox""
  },
  {
    ""id"": ""23423536"",
    ""name"": ""Edmund Pevensie""
  }
]
```

And use it to generate new items, containing just the name, along with a new piece of data:

```js
newItems = [];
for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){
  newItems.push(
    {
    ""json"":
      {
        ""name"": items[i].json.name,
				""aBrandNewField"": ""New data for item "" + i
      }
    }
  )
}

return newItems;
```

`newItems` is an array of items with no `pairedItem`. This means there's no way to trace back from these items to the items used to generate them.

Add the `pairedItem` object:

```js
newItems = [];
for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){
  newItems.push(
    {
      ""json"":
        {
          ""name"": items[i].json.name,
					""aBrandNewField"": ""New data for item "" + i
        },
      ""pairedItem"": i
    }    
  )
}
return newItems;
```

Each new item now links to the item used to create it."
item-linking-node-creators,"/// note | Programmatic-style nodes only
This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.
///

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this. 

This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information on node styles.

Start by reading [Item linking concepts](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/), which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.

If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting `pairedItem` on each item your node returns:

```typescript
// Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item
newItem = {
	""json"": { . . . },
	""pairedItem"": {
		""item"": item.pairedItem,
		// Optional: choose the input to use
		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
		""input"": 0
};

// Or set the index manually
newItem = {
		""json"": { . . . }
		""pairedItem"": {
			""item"": i,
			// Optional: choose the input to use
			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
			""input"": 0
		},
};
```"
smartjoin,"```js
// Input
{{ [{""type"":""fruit"", ""name"":""apple""},{""type"":""vegetable"", ""name"":""carrot""} ].smartJoin(""type"",""name"") }}
// Output
[Object: {""fruit"":""apple"",""vegetable"":""carrot""}]
```"
create-set-error-workflow,"1. Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node. 
2. Give the workflow a name, for example `Error Handler`. 
3. Select **Save**.
4. In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
	1. Select **Options** <span class=""inline-image"">![Options menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> > **Settings**.
	2. In **Error workflow**, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select **Error handler**.
	3. Select **Save**.
	Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs."
data-flow-nodes,"Nodes can process multiple items.

For example, if you set the Trello node to `Create-Card`, and create an expression that sets `Name` using a property called `name-input-value` from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the `name-input-value` of the current item.

For example, this input will create two cards. One named `test1` the other one named `test2`:

```json
[
	{
		name-input-value: ""test1""
	},
	{
		name-input-value: ""test2""
	}
]

subworkflow-data-flow,"For example, there's an Execute Workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Workflow node calls another workflow, **Workflow B**:

subworkflow-usage,"### Create the sub-workflow

1. Create a new workflow.

	1. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting.	Refer to [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.
1. Add the **Execute Workflow Trigger** node.
1. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.		
1. Save the sub-workflow.

/// note | Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors
If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.  
///
/// note | Load data into sub-workflow before building
This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](/workflows/executions/debug/), which is available to Pro and Enterprise users.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Workflow Trigger**. 
1. In the sub-workflow [settings](/workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**. 
1. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
1. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](/workflows/executions/debug/).
You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.
///


### Call the sub-workflow

1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.
1. Add the **Execute Workflow** node.
1. In the **Execute Workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.

    /// note | Find your workflow ID
    Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.
    ///

1. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it."
credential-only-intro,"One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. n8n provides credentials support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.

* Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.
* Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration."

submit-community-node,"/// note | Subject to change
The standards described in this document are for the first release of the community nodes repository. These may change in future releases.
///
Community nodes are npm packages, hosted in the npm registry.

When building a node to submit to the community node repository, use the following resources to make sure your node setup is correct:

* View the [starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter){:target=_blank .external-link} and [n8n's own nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes){:target=_blank .external-link} for some examples.
* Refer to the documentation on [building your own nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/).
* Make sure your node follows the [standards](#standards) for community nodes.

## Standards

To make your node available to the n8n community node repository, you must:

* Make sure the package name starts with `n8n-nodes-` or `@<scope>/n8n-nodes-`. For example, `n8n-nodes-weather` or `@weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather`.
* Include `n8n-community-node-package` in your package keywords.
* Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the `package.json` file inside the `n8n` attribute. Refer to the [package.json in the starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/package.json){:target=_blank .external-link} for an example.
* Check your node using the [linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter/) and test it locally to ensure it works.
* Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on [Contributing packages to the registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information."
node-operations,"## Node operations: Triggers and Actions

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

* Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon <span class=""inline-image"">![Trigger icon](/_images/common-icons/trigger.png){.off-glb}</span>.
* Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected."
poll-modes,"### Every Hour mode

Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.

* Enter the **Day of the Month** to trigger the poll, from `0` to `31`.

### Every X mode

* Enter the **Value** of measurement for how often to trigger the poll in either minutes or hours.
* Select the **Unit** for the value. Supported units are **Minutes** and **Hours**.

### Custom mode

Enter a custom **Cron Expression** to trigger the poll. Use these values and ranges:

* Seconds: `0` - `59`
* Minutes: `0` - `59`
* Hours: `0` - `23`
* Day of Month: `1` - `31`
* Months: `0` - `11` (Jan - Dec)
* Day of Week: `0` - `6` (Sun - Sat)

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru){:target=_blank .external-link}. Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Cron Expression** field in n8n.

#### Examples

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08:30, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.
```
30 8 4 * * *
```

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.
```
8 4 * * *

operation-not-supported,"## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node: 

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. Select the service you want to connect to.
1. Select your credential.

    - **Let Google Sheets format** (default): n8n formats text and numbers in the cells according to Google Sheets' default settings. 
    - **Let n8n format**: New cells in your sheet will have the same data types as the input data provided by n8n.
- **Data Location on Sheet**: Use this option when you need to specify the data range on your sheet.
    - **Header Row**: Specify the row index that contains the column headers.
    - **First Data Row**: Specify the row index where the actual data starts.
- **Handling extra fields in input**: When using **Mapping Column Mode > Map Automatically**, use this option to decide how to handle fields in the input data that don't match any existing columns in the sheet.
    - **Insert in New Column(s)** (default): Adds new columns for any extra data.
    - **Ignore Them**: Ignores extra data that don't match the existing columns. 
    - **Error**: Throws an error and stops execution. 
- **Use Append**: Turn on this option to use the [Google API append endpoint](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/values#append_values){:target=_blank .external-link} for adding new data rows.
    - By default, n8n appends empty rows or columns and then adds the new data. This approach can ensure data alignment but may be less efficient. Using the append endpoint can lead to better performance by minimizing the number of API calls and simplifying the process. But if the existing sheet data has inconsistencies such as gaps or breaks between rows and columns, n8n may add the new data in the wrong place, leading to misalignment issues.
    - Use this option when performance is a priority and the data structure in the sheet is consistent without gaps."
cluster-nodes-summary,"Cluster nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a root node and one or more sub-nodes that extend the functionality of the node.

sub-node-expression-resolution,"/// note | Parameter resolution in sub-nodes
Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

///

/// note | Function and Function Item nodes
The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Function node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function.md){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Function Item node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.functionItem.md){:target=_blank .external-link}.
///
## Usage

How to use the Code node.

### Choose a mode

There are two modes:

* **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
* **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.

## JavaScript

The Code node supports Node.js.

### Supported JavaScript features

The Code node supports:

* Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
* Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

### External libraries

If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.

If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:

* [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html){:target=_blank .external-link}
* [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment){:target=_blank .external-link}

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.


## Python

n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/){:target=_blank .external-link}, which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide){:target=_blank .external-link}. n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

/// note | Slower than JavaScript
The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.
///
### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

## File system and HTTP requests

You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:

* [Read/Write File From Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)
* [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

## Coding in n8n

There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.

### Key concepts

When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:

* [Data structure](/data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
* [Item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

* Accessing specific item data
* Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
* Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview) for more information.

///
If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.

One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.

For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the **true** output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the **false** data stream.

timezone-settings,"/// note | Timezone settings
The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:

1. The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings/) for more information.
2. The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/).

testing,"You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

1. Install n8n using npm:
  ```shell
  npm install n8n -g
  ```
2. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:
  ```shell
  # In your node directory
  npm run build
  npm link
  ```
3. Install the node into your local n8n instance:
  ```shell
  # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
  # node-package-name is the name from the package.json
  npm link <node-package-name>
  ```

    /// note | Check your directory
	Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be: 
	
	* `~/.n8n/custom/`
	* `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.
	///

4. Start n8n:
  ```
  n8n start
  ```
5. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.

    /// note | Node names
    Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`. 
    ///

### Troubleshooting

- There's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation.

# In ~/.n8n directory run
mkdir custom 
cd custom

reduce-memory-consumption,"* Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution.
* Avoid using the Code node where possible.
* Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data.
* Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow.

Splitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to split up the items into smaller batches and the [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node to start the sub-workflow.

However, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again."
